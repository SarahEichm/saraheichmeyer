Cohen, his personal lawyer, made to a pornographic film actress several months before he denied any knowledge of it to reporters aboard Air Force One in April, according to two people familiar with the arrangement. <br /> How much Mr. Trump knew about the payment to Stephanie Clifford, the actress, and who else was aware of it have been at the center of a swirling controversy for the past 48 hours touched off by a television interview with Rudolph W. Giuliani, a new addition to the president's legal team. The interview was the first time a lawyer for the president had acknowledged that Mr. Trump had reimbursed Mr. Cohen for the payments to Ms. Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels. <br /> It was not immediately clear when Mr. Trump learned of the payment, which Mr. Cohen made in October 2016, at a time when news media outlets were poised to pay her for her story about an alleged affair with Mr. Trump in 2006. But three people close to the matter said that Mr. Trump knew that Mr. Cohen had succeeded in keeping the allegations from becoming public at the time the president denied it. <br /> Ms. Clifford signed a nondisclosure agreement, and accepted the payment just days before Mr. Trump won the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Trump has denied he had an affair with Ms. Clifford and insisted that the nondisclosure agreement was created to prevent any embarrassment to his family. <br /> Mr. Giuliani said this week that the reimbursement to Mr. Cohen totaled $460,000 or $470,000, leaving it unclear what else the payments were for beyond the $130,000 that went to Ms. Clifford. One of the people familiar with the arrangement said that it was a $420,000 total over 12 months. <br /> From complete denial to acknowledging involvement, what President Trump and his lawyers said about the $130,000 paid to the pornographic film actress. <br /> Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, has known since last year the details of how Mr. Cohen was being reimbursed, which was mainly through payments of $35,000 per month from the trust that contains the president's personal fortune, according to two people with knowledge of the arrangement. <br /> One person close to the Trump Organization said people with the company were aware that Mr. Cohen was still doing 'legal work' for the president in 2017, but another person familiar with the situation said that Mr. Weisselberg did not know that Mr. Cohen had paid Ms. Clifford when the retainer agreement was struck and when the payments went through. <br /> Mr. Weisselberg's knowledge of the retainer agreement could draw Mr. Trump's company deeper into the federal investigation of Mr. Cohen's activities, increasing the president's legal exposure in a wide-ranging case involving the lawyer often described as the president's 'fixer' in New York City. <br /> In interviews on Wednesday and Thursday, Mr. Giuliani insisted that the president had reimbursed Mr. Cohen for the $130,000 hush payment - and then paid him another $330,000, if not more - which was in direct conflict with the longstanding assertion by Mr. Trump and the White House that he did not know about the hush money or where it came from. <br /> In an interview with The [outlet] on Friday, Mr. Giuliani sought to clarify his statements by saying that he did not know whether Mr. Trump had known that some of the payments to Mr. Cohen had gone to Ms. Clifford. 'It's not something I'm aware of, nor is it relevant to what I'm doing, the legal part,' Mr. Giuliani said. <br /> Mr. Giuliani acknowledged that 'politically,' it could be troublesome. 'Politically, everything matters, but I don't see a problem here, at least not' legally, he said. <br /> A lawyer for the Trump Organization declined to comment, and a spokeswoman for the organization did not respond to an email about Mr. Weisselberg. <br /> The president has said that he would view any investigation into his finances or those of his family as 'a violation,' though he was referring to the investigation into Russia by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III; the investigation into Mr. Cohen is being run by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. <br /> The payment to Ms. Clifford is a part of that investigation. The circumstances surrounding it had become all the murkier this week after Mr. Giuliani gave an explanation of how the funds to Ms. Clifford were accounted for that contradicted all those that came before it. <br /> After initially appearing to back Mr. Giuliani's assertions in a series of Twitter messages on Thursday, Mr. Trump reversed course on Friday, after a series of headlines suggesting that the president had lied about knowing of the hush payment. In remarks to reporters on Friday, Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Giuliani and said he would eventually 'get his facts straight.' <br /> 'Virtually everything said has been said incorrectly, and it's been said wrong, or it's been covered wrong by the press,' Mr. Trump told reporters, though he excused Mr. Giuliani by explaining he had 'just started a day ago.' <br /> In a written statement later in the day, Mr. Giuliani said that he had not been 'describing my understanding of the president's knowledge.' And he reversed a previous suggestion that the payment to Ms. Clifford was motivated by the election. Mr. Giuliani said on Friday that the payment was personal in nature and 'would have been done in any event, whether he was a candidate or not.' Mr. Giuliani told The Times that he had 'confused' the two factors, but that it was irrelevant since Mr. Trump had repaid Mr. Cohen. <br /> While some White House officials had insisted that Mr. Trump was pleased with Mr. Giuliani's performance on [outlet] in an interview with Sean Hannity on Wednesday night, two people close to the president painted a different picture. They said that Mr. Trump was displeased with how Mr. Giuliani, a former New York mayor, conducted himself, and that he was also unhappy with Mr. Hannity, a commentator whose advice the president often seeks, in terms of the language he used to describe the payments to Ms. Clifford. <br /> The nature of the payments is significant because of campaign finance laws that regulate who may contribute to candidates and how much they can give. <br /> If Mr. Cohen or others paid to silence Ms. Clifford primarily out of fear that a public airing of her story would have harmed Mr. Trump's election prospects - rather than to keep it from his family for personal reasons - then the payment would most likely be viewed as an illegal campaign expenditure. Mr. Giuliani told The Times on Friday that the issue was 'primarily' about keeping Mr. Trump's wife, Melania, from being embarrassed by the claim, which Mr. Trump has maintained was false. <br /> Lawyers from inside and outside the White House are confronting the Mueller inquiry, while others are focused on payments made to silence a pornographic film actress who said she had sex with Mr. Trump. <br /> But if investigators determine that the hush payment was in effect a campaign expenditure, then how the funds were distributed could take on added legal significance. Mr. Cohen had been careful to say that neither the campaign nor the Trump Organization was involved in the deal or any effort to reimburse him. <br /> Under campaign finance law, Mr. Trump would have been within his rights to pay Ms. Clifford himself as a way to protect his presidential prospects - though he would have had to have formally made note of it in his public campaign filings, which had no accounting of the payment. If he directed Mr. Cohen to pay it on his behalf, then that could qualify as an illegal, coordinated campaign expenditure, even if Mr. Trump later paid him back. <br /> Any involvement by the Trump Organization would further complicate the legal picture, given that American election law is strictest of all when it comes to corporate involvement with political campaigns. Businesses are not allowed to donate directly to campaigns or to coordinate with them. <br /> Ms. Clifford's lawyer, Michael J. Avenatti, has been arguing for months that Mr. Trump's company was more involved in the arrangement than Mr. Cohen had been letting on. <br /> After filing a lawsuit on Ms. Clifford's behalf seeking to get out of the deal - which he has called invalid - Mr. Avenatti showed that Mr. Cohen had used his Trump Organization email at one point in arranging the payment. He also pointed to a secret document in California that a Trump Organization lawyer filed to force Ms. Clifford into arbitration this year. <br /> At the time, the Trump Organization said that the lawyer, Jill A. Martin, who works in California, had acted in a personal capacity to help Mr. Cohen, who needed assistance with the initial arbitration filing from someone licensed in the state. The Trump Organization had said that 'the company has had no involvement in the matter.' <br /> In an interview, Mr. Avenatti said that any indication that still more executives at the Trump Organization knew about the effort to reimburse Mr. Cohen for the payment to Ms. Clifford could lead to further investigation of the Trump family business. <br /> 'There's no question it opens up another avenue of inquiry into the depths of the involvement of the Trump Organization,' he said."], "ID2" : ["https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/may/1/tom-price-repeal-obamacare-mandate-will-drive-cost/", "Repeal of Obamacare mandate will drive up costs: Tom Price", "Former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said Tuesday the GOP's decision to repeal Obamacare's individual mandate without a broader overhaul of the heath care system will likely increase costs on consumers who remain in the program. <br /> The comments from Mr. Price, who was ousted from HHS last fall over his pricey business travel, were remarkable, since he claimed the mandate was ineffective while in office. Also, Democrats have been making the same argument in accusing President Trump and his Republican allies of sabotaging the 2010 law's marketplace. <br /> GOP majorities were unable to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act last year, though they zeroed out penalties tied to its unpopular mandate to hold insurance as part of a tax overhaul later on, saying middle-class Americans needed financial relief. <br /> TOP STORIESChurches, it's time to open, and open wideGeorgia kicks off chilling door-to-door COVID-19 blood collectionsTrump: No Fauci testimony because House is 'bunch of Trump-haters' <br /> 'That may help, but it still is nibbling at the side,' Mr. Price told the World Heath Care Congress in D.C. 'And there are many, and I'm one of them, who believes that that actually will harm the pool in the exchange market, because you'll likely have individuals who are younger and healthier not participating in that market, and consequently, that drives up the cost for other folks within that market.' <br /> Mr. Price's comments were a turnabout from his time in the administration, when he said the mandate wasn't working and that people were shirking coverage because they didn't like what President Obama's signature program had to offer. <br /> Actuaries say premiums may rise by 10 percent, on average, due to the loss of the mandate, as insurers gird for a sicker consumer pool due to the loss of the mandate. Some blue states, like New Jersey, are poised to slap the penalties back onto residents through their state tax systems, however. <br /> Capitol Hill Democrats and moderate Republicans tried to ameliorate the efforts of repealing the mandate with an Obamacare stabilization bill, though their efforts fell apart amid rancor over abortion and mid-term campaign politics. Conservative lawmakers also refused to support any bill that would bolster Obamacare. <br /> American Bridge 21st Century, a progressive group that monitors GOP rhetoric, said Mr. Price's 'shocking admission' suggests health care will be a liability for Republicans at the ballot box. <br /> 'Tom Price just broke with Trump and congressional Republicans while confirming what nonpartisan experts and Democrats warned of all along: that by undermining the ACA, the Republican tax giveaway to the rich will cost Americans their health care coverage and raise out-of-pocket costs even more,' organization spokesman Andrew Bates said. <br /> Mr. Price, a former congressman from Georgia, said what to do about the mandate and the vast expansion of Medicaid, the insurance program for the poor, were the key sticking points that doomed the GOP's efforts to replace Obamacare last year. <br /> He was criticized for not doing more to get the effort across the finish line, and he was nudged out of office after a series of Politico reports revealed he used expensive private plans for travel instead of cheaper options. <br /> Mr. Price said moving forward, a bill that would bundle Obamacare money and siphon it back to the states as block grants is a promising option. <br /> The bill, know as 'Graham-Cassidy,' fell short last year but is the preferred option for the White House and GOP lawmakers moving forward, though Mr. Price says he doesn't expect congressional leaders to court another heath debate before the November election. <br /> 'Politics will likely get in the way of that,' he said. <br /> Mr. Price said an effort to take down Obamacare in the courts could gain traction, however. <br /> A group of Republican attorneys general say that since the mandate penalty is now zero, the government is no longer collecting a tax. They say Chief Justice John G. Roberts pointed to Congress' taxing authority to uphold the law as constitutional in 2012, so the entire program should fall. <br /> 'I don't know what the court is going to do with that, but it is percolating out there,' Mr. Price said. <br /> He said the case could result in another showdown before the Supreme Court. <br />  <br /> Copyright C 2020 The [outlet], LLC. <br />                        <br />                          Click<br />                            here for reprint permission. <br /> "], "ID3" : ["https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/06/james-wolfe-leak-investigation-journalists-double-standard/", "Leak Investigations, Journalists, and Double Standards", "The media are in a lather over the Justice Department's grand-jury investigation of contacts between several reporters and a government source - the former Senate Intelligence Committee security director who has been indicted for lying to investigators about his leaks to the press. <br /> The same media are in a lather over the refusal of the president of the United States, at least thus far, to submit to questioning by the special counsel in the Russia investigation. The president is placing himself 'above the law,' they contend, if he rebuffs prosecutors or defies a grand-jury subpoena. <br /> Whether we're talking about journalists or presidents, the situation is the same: An investigative demand is made on people whose jobs are so important to the functioning of our self-governing republic that they are given some protection, but not absolute immunity, from the obligation to provide evidence to the grand jury. <br /> And whether it's a reporter or the chief executive, the question is: Under what circumstances should they be forced to testify? <br /> The oddity - a very human oddity - is that the press is extraordinarily attuned to its own need for protection but scoffs at the notion that someone with greater responsibilities should have comparable protections. <br /> James A. Wolfe, who was indicted on Thursday, is a textbook swamp creature. According to the [outlet], he is a former army intelligence analyst who 30 years ago latched on to the Senate Intelligence Committee as a staffer. A non-partisan staffer, of course. The Senate Intelligence Committee, a pillar of the Beltway establishment, is nothing if not self-congratulatory about its cross-the-aisle comity. It doesn't do much, but rest assured that what little it does is awesomely bipartisan . . . except to the extent it is admirably non-partisan. <br /> Wolfe eventually rose to the post of security director, responsible for receiving, maintaining and managing all classified intelligence shared with the committee by U.S. spy agencies (or is it informant agencies?). So, what's a good, upstanding, bipartisan, non-partisan Washington bureaucrat to do in such a coveted slot? Why, selectively leak classified information to favored journalists, that's what. <br /> In the case of Wolfe, who is 57, these journos most prominently included Ali Watkins, a 26-year-old Times reporter with whom he was romantically involved for three years - mostly while she was working her way to the Gray Lady as a national-security reporter for the Huffington Post, Politico, McClatchy, and BuzzFeed. The indictment alleges that the couple exchanged 'tens of thousands of electronic communications, often including daily texts and phone calls,' as well as 'encrypted cell phone applications.' <br /> Now, sit down because I know you'll be shocked to hear this: Wolfe's bipartisan, non-partisan intelligence leaks from the bipartisan, non-partisan Senate Intelligence Committee had a decidedly anti-Trump flavor. <br /> For example, in spring 2017, Wolfe tipped Ms. Watkins that Russian spies had attempted to recruit Trump-campaign adviser Carter Page back in 2013. This leak did not occur in a vacuum. It had been revealed that the Obama Justice Department used the unverified Steele dossier, generated by the Clinton campaign, to obtain FISA-court surveillance warrants against Page. To control the damage, Democrats and other, uh, non-partisans wanted to claim that the FBI had reasons independent of the dossier to suspect that Page was a clandestine agent of Russia. <br /> Wolfe obliged with the leak, enabling Watkins to write a BuzzFeed article provocatively headlined 'A Former Trump Adviser Met with a Russian Spy' - although the story could just as easily have been entitled 'A Former Trump Adviser Helped Justice Department Prosecute Russian Spies.' (Page voluntarily provided information that prosecutors used to arrest Moscow's operatives.) <br /> The indictment implies that Watkins's story was based in part on top-secret intelligence provided to the committee by a U.S. intelligence agency on March 17. On that day, Wolfe and Watkins exchanged 82 texts, in addition to having a lengthy phone call. On April 3, the day the story was published, they exchanged 124 texts and spoke on the phone after Watkins appeared on national television to discuss her report. <br /> Wolfe cultivated other journalists, too, using what the indictment calls 'anonymizing messaging applications,' and arranging surreptitious meetings in restaurants, bars, private residences, and secluded areas of the Hart Senate Office Building. Wolfe gave one unidentified reporter a heads-up that the committee had subpoenaed Page, and he even provided that reporter with Page's personal contact information. Later, after the reporter's story was published, Wolfe extended congratulations: 'Good job! . . . I'm glad you got the scoop.' The reporter responded with thanks, noting that Page was not 'pleased' but did not deny being subpoenaed. Page complained to the committee about media leaks, to no avail. <br /> While the committee posed as the embodiment of discretion, its security director was offering himself as a regular anonymous source. According to the indictment, Wolfe told one journalist he could play that role, provided that his name never be mentioned to the journalist's colleagues. More touching was his text to Watkins, in December 2017, around the time their romance ended: <br /> I've watched your career take off even before you ever had a career in journalism. . . . I always tried to give you as much information as I could and to do the right thing with it so you could get that scoop before anyone else. . . . I always enjoyed the way that you would pursue a story like nobody else was doing in my hallway. I felt like I was part of your excitement and was always very supportive of your career and the tenacity that you exhibited to chase down a good story. <br /> Not quite 'Shall I compare thee to a summer's day,' but you get the point. <br /> When interviewed by the FBI on December 15, Wolfe denied knowing Watkins's sources until he was confronted with pictures showing the two of them together. He then conceded that he had lied and acknowledged having had a personal relationship with Watkins, but denied giving her non-public information or investigative leads. He flatly denied contacts with other reporters, though he had evidently been in regular contact with them. <br /> Wolfe has been charged with three counts of lying to investigators. <br /> These allegations appear airtight and, in the aggregate, carry a potential 15 years' imprisonment. It is possible that classified-information offenses could be added to the indictment. On the other hand, the Justice Department may see wisdom in proceeding on the false-statements charges alone. That might enable prosecutors to avoid (a) publicizing the intelligence Wolfe allegedly disclosed and (b) sorting out what information was classified (and whether Wolfe knew it was classified). <br /> In the course of the investigation, the Justice Department used subpoenas to obtain records from telecommunications companies pertaining to the journalists. It appears that investigators were cautious in their approach - for example, they acquired 'metadata' records showing with whom and when Ms. Watkins was having email and phone contacts; but they did not seek the content of the communications. To the extent they seized message content, it appears to have been on Wolfe's end - likely through government devices issued to him by the committee for official business. <br /> Nevertheless, the specter of investigators rifling though journalists' communication records causes the media consternation. It is thus worth observing that, contrary to popular belief, the press does not have a sweeping privilege insulating reporters from investigation or from being compelled to disclose information to the grand jury. <br /> In its 1972 decision in Branzburg v. Hayes, the Supreme Court held that, if subpoenaed, journalists have a legal obligation to testify, and specifically to answer questions relevant to a criminal investigation. Reporters often promise their sources confidentiality, but it is not a legally enforceable promise; the reporters are betting on the reluctance of the government to challenge the arrangement. <br /> There are virtually no rights and privileges that are absolute or without qualification. <br /> It is a good bet. The Justice Department adheres to strict regulations against interfering in the First Amendment freedom of the press. The regs bar prosecutors from compelling journalists to surrender information unless there are reasonable grounds to believe (a) a serious crime has occurred, (b) the information sought from the journalist is essential to proving that crime, and (c) the journalist appears to be the only source from which the information can be obtained. And even if these conditions are satisfied, prosecutors are admonished that their subpoenas 'should not be used to obtain peripheral, nonessential, cumulative, or speculative information.' <br /> That is far more protection than the average person gets. It is, moreover, all to the good. For all our grousing about media bias, it is a fact that a democratic society cannot function, govern itself, and make salutary policy choices without a free press that investigates vigorously and reports fearlessly. <br /> Nevertheless, there are virtually no rights and privileges that are absolute or without qualification. In over 99 percent of investigations, there is no thought to coercing, much less need to coerce, reporters into testifying. But there is the rare significant case in which a journalist is an essential witness to criminal misconduct, possesses life-and-death information, or may even be complicit in law-breaking. In those situations, and with a closely supervised Justice Department review process, it must be possible to demand information from journalists, just as it is demanded from every citizen. <br /> That is the rare exception, though, not the rule. Demands on the media must be limited to those highly unusual instances in which prosecutors can meet this exacting burden. <br /> Most responsible media advocates grasp this. The Times, for example, quotes Mark J. MacDougall, a lawyer for Ms. Watkins, who observes that whether it is 'really necessary' for the Justice Department to obtain a journalist's phone records 'will depend on the nature of the investigation and the scope of any charges.' That's reasonable - it's not saying this must never be done, just that when it is done there better be a damn good explanation. <br /> Still, it would be nice if the media grasped that they are not the only constitutionally recognized actors who rate some deference. At the moment, President Trump's lawyers are fighting efforts by the special counsel to pressure him into an interview - perhaps even into testimony before a grand jury. Like journalists, the president has an extremely important job - most would say, the most important job - in our system. Like journalists, the president has a privilege of confidentiality - one that actually has been endorsed by the Supreme Court. And as is the case with the protections afforded journalists by Justice Department regulations and practice, the chief executive's privilege is not absolute - it must give way when there is evidence of a serious crime, when the president is somehow implicated in that crime, and when the president possesses critical information that cannot be obtained from any other source. <br /> Most commentators sympathetic to Trump's position do not question whether a president should ever be subpoenaed (or asked to submit to prosecutorial questioning). The question is whether, before a subpoena is issued, the prosecutor should be required to establish that the president's testimony is really necessary. Is there a crime Mr. Mueller is investigating as to which there is vital evidence that can be obtained only from the president? <br /> Reporters clearly grasp the need for such solicitude when it comes to themselves."], "ID4" : ["usatoday.com/story/news/2018/03/14/thousands-students-across-u-s-walk-out-class-today-protest-gun-violence/420731002", "'We deserve better': Students nationwide walk out in massive protest over gun violence", "Thousands of students across the nation walked out of classrooms and into a political firestorm Wednesday, marking one month since the bloody rampage at a Florida high school shocked the world and fueled their dynamic movement demanding an end to gun violence. <br /> Students from about 2,800 schools marked National Walkout Day, many by leaving their classrooms at 10 a.m. to show solidarity for the 17 killed in the attack Feb. 14 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. <br /> In Parkland, students gathered on the football field, embraced and chanted, 'MSD!' and 'We want change!' Rejecting requests from administrators to return to classes, they joined students from a nearby middle school to walk 2 miles to memorials set up for the victims. <br /> 'To the parents supporting their children walking out, thank you for raising this new generation of leaders,' tweeted Stoneman Douglas student Cameron Kasky. 'To the parents who didn't support their children who walked out anyway, thank you for raising this new generation of leaders.' <br /> At Columbine High School south of Denver, hundreds of students solemnly filed onto the soccer field for a short rally. They released balloons to memorialize the Parkland victims, along with the 13 people killed at their own school 19 years ago. <br /> 'We should never go to school in fear of our lives,' said sophomore Leah Zundel, 15, as her voice broke.

Gun control! When do we want it? Now!' Bella Graham, a seventh-grader at Takoma Park Middle School in Maryland, said she needed to support the students in Parkland. <br /> 'I shouldn't have to be here,' said Graham, carrying a sign that read 'An assault on our future' with a photo of a rifle. 'I should be in school, but we have to stick up for ourselves and say enough is enough of this violence.' <br /> While the protests rolled on, Democrats in the Senate gave speeches and read the names of young people killed by gun violence. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., where the Sandy Hook tragedy took place more than five years ago, said the protesting students' 'energy and passion is a civics lesson for America.' <br /> The National Rifle Association chimed in on Twitter, asking that 'we work together to stop school violence' and pressing its case that banks and stadiums are better protected than schools. The NRA tweeted a picture of a semiautomatic rifle with the words 'I'll control my own guns, thank you.' <br /> But this day's voice belonged to the students. <br /> In Nevada, hundreds of North Valleys High School students filled the stands of their football stadium in Reno to release 17 balloons and hold a 17-second moment of silence. Freshman Marina Johnson held a sign that read, 'Your children, not your guns.' <br /> 'The memorial service is great,' Johnson said. 'But we can't just have a memorial service every time this happens.' <br /> In Indiana, 17 students at Herron High School near downtown Indianapolis stood in a circle  and held photos of those who died in Parkland. Hundreds of students held signs reading 'Never again' and 'Enough is enough.' Some chanted, 'Make change now!' and 'We deserve better!' <br /> At some schools, the message was mixed. At Vero Beach High School, about 100 miles north of Parkland, scores of students gathered around a flagpole where their cries of 'We want change!' and 'Am I next?' were met with other students' chants of 'Trump!' and 'We want guns.' <br /> At other schools, administrators discouraged the protests, warning that participation could result in disciplinary actions. <br /> In Kentucky, more than 100 North Oldham  High School student protesters face 30-minute detentions. The school banned protests for safety reasons, spokeswoman Lori McDowell said, adding that the 'punishment was for defying authority, not for participating.' <br /> In South Carolina, the Greenville school district barred the news media from schools during the protests, hoping to discourage them. District spokeswoman Beth Brotherton said a student protest for gun control measures is a divisive act,  and students should instead 'focus on kindness.' Many students at J.L. Mann and Hillcrest high schools walked out anyway. <br /> At most schools, staff accommodated the planned demonstrations - some faculty even cheered on students. <br /> In New Jersey, about 1,000 students silently walked the perimeter of Plainfield High School. Some school staff joined them. <br /> 'I am very proud of our students,' performing arts teacher Shaniesha Evans said. 'This was their idea, and this is what they wanted to do.' <br /> In Haddonfield, N.J., teachers held their own march before school. About 100 students, teachers, parents and administrators came together, many carrying signs or wearing orange ribbons. <br /> 'This walk is our way of showing our students we support them and believe in keeping them safe,' said Stacey Brown, an English and special education teacher at Haddonfield Memorial High School. <br /> In Arizona, hundreds of students at Mountain Ridge High School in Glendale walked onto the campus football field, forming giant letters on the 50-yard line that spelled 'ENOUGH.' <br /> 'I know it's not just our school,' senior Cassidy Crane said. 'It's schools across the nation doing the same thing as us. It just takes a couple of people to stand up.' <br /> In Michigan, North Farmington High School students wore T-shirts with the hashtag #enough on the front and the names of the Florida shooting victims on the back. The students observed a six-minute moment of silence - the amount of time it took the Florida shooter to kill 17 people. Then they read the names of the victims - one every 17 seconds. <br /> Wednesday's walkouts marked the first in a series of events in March and April organized by students across the nation as part of the #NeverAgain movement. Another walkout is scheduled for April 20 to mark the 19th year since the Columbine High School massacre. <br /> A massive rally dubbed March for Our Lives is planned March 24 in Washington. The event is trying to attract 500,000 people and has spurred sister marches in every state. <br /> In Minnesota, Genesis Knoblach was among about 100 students at St. John's Preparatory School in Collegeville walking in freezing temperatures Wednesday to the steps in front of St. John's Abbey.

And without those Democratic votes, Senate Republicans can't break the 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster. <br /> Because Democrats represent the main obstacle, Republican leaders have pre-emptively blamed them for the looming government shutdown. 'If Senate Democrats obstruct this legislation-and as a result shut down the government-they have made the decision to cut off pay to our troops and block children's health care funding they support,' said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, after House Republicans passed a stopgap bill on Thursday night that would keep the government open for a month while funding the Children's Health Insurance Program for six years. <br /> Rhetoric aside, however, the Republican Party is in an emergency of its own making. If, once again, Americans face a government shutdown, it's because Republicans refuse to act as a governing party, wasting time on political gambits instead of doing the difficult work of finding consensus. [Update: It's official. The failure to pass the continuing resolution led to a shutdown at midnight.] <br /> It's true that Democrats insist on a permanent solution for young unauthorized immigrants as part of any spending bill. The reason is straightforward: If a bill passes without action on these 'Dreamers,' Democrats will lose the leverage to craft one on their terms. But this crisis is only occurring because President Trump decided to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which granted protection from deportation to hundreds of thousands of young immigrants. <br /> While Trump insists he wants to find a solution to this problem, his own statements are at odds with his behavior. Last week, the president scuttled the deal brokered by Sens. Lindsey Graham and Dick Durbin, following a now-infamous meeting where Trump called both Haiti and various African nations 'shitholes.' Since then, the White House has been silent on what it wants from a deal, although Trump's priorities aren't hard to discern-he wants more white immigrants and fewer immigrants from countries whose citizens are largely black and brown. By putting the brakes on a viable compromise, Trump made this standoff inevitable. <br /> The same is true of the Children's Health Insurance Program. Since its funding lapsed late last year, congressional Republicans have refused to reauthorize CHIP, ignoring the problem in favor of passing tax cuts and tending to other priorities. Republican leaders like Paul Ryan might blast Senate Democrats for their current obstinance on this short-term funding bill, but their refusal to act last year belies their newfound concern for the program. The brinksmanship we see now has less to do with Democratic intransigence and more to do with a choice, by both Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, to use CHIP in a late-game legislative play. (The House eventually passed a bill with CHIP funding attached, but it was almost scuttled when President Trump tweeted his desire for a stopgap bill that didn't include the program.) <br /> That the House could move on a short-term bill was itself a minor miracle. On Tuesday, when House leadership presented the measure to rank-and-file Republicans, it was met with defiance from the conservative radicals in the House Freedom Caucus, who threatened to torpedo the proposal out of anger at being fed another stopgap bill. This left Paul Ryan with a choice. He could circumvent the Freedom Caucus and negotiate with Democrats, or he could make concessions and hope to pin blame for a shutdown on Democrats. He chose the latter, illustrating just how much conservative Republicans are still acting as if they're in the minority and demonstrating Ryan's reluctance to lead rather than follow the demands of his most disruptive members. <br /> If there is a shutdown, Republicans appear more likely than not to take the blame for it. According to a new poll from ABC News and the Washington Post, 48 percent of Americans say Trump and Republicans are to blame for a potential government shutdown, compared with 28 percent who say they will blame Democrats and 18 percent who say they will blame both parties equally. Among independents, 46 percent blame the GOP. <br /> A few months after taking office, President Trump called for a 'good shutdown' to fix the 'mess' in Washington. He was frustrated; Democrats had walked away with the better end of a deal that kept the government open through the end of summer. Now, a year later, Trump has gotten his wish-except this impending shutdown won't help him win concessions or attain an advantage over his opponents. Instead, it reflects his failure-and the failure of congressional Republicans-to govern competently. That failure has left them in the absurd position of scrambling to blame Democrats for a shutdown happening under their complete control."], "ID9" : ["https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/06/trump-v-hawaii-the-travel-ban-ruling-will-be-the-roberts-courts-shameful-legacy.html", "The Travel Ban Ruling Will Be the Roberts Court's Shameful Legacy", "When the Supreme Court upheld Donald Trump's travel ban on Tuesday by a 5-4 vote, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a dissent joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, compared the majority opinion to Korematsu, the Supreme Court case that infamously upheld the Japanese internment. Chief Justice John Roberts, the author of the majority opinion in Trump v. Hawaii, complained that the comparison was unfair. In one respect, Roberts is correct: The Korematsu court at least didn't have any warning it was being misled by the Department of Justice. Roberts, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch explicitly dismissed the well-documented warnings that the travel ban and its waiver program may be a fraud. <br /> The lawyers, most notably Solicitor General Charles Fahy, who hid evidence and misled the Korematsu court in 1944 are forever tainted by their immoral and grossly unprofessional misconduct. These five justices, along with Solicitor General Noel Francisco, face the same shameful legacy. <br /> Let's briefly review Francisco's conduct. As Joshua Geltzer documented in [outlet], Francisco misstated the core facts about Trump's statements of animus toward Muslims in oral arguments and generally was misleading about Trump's animus. Strike 1. Francisco filed an insufficient three-sentence letter of correction that addressed only one factual error and did not address the larger problem of mischaracterizing Trump's animus. Strike 2. <br /> The justices had asked in oral arguments whether the travel ban's waiver program-the existence of which the DOJ relied on to argue that the ban was a fair and standard presidential directive-was merely 'window dressing.' Statistics and individual cases of denials had already suggested that the waiver process may be a sham. As Jeremy Stahl has reported, a former consular officer said in a sworn affidavit that he had no discretion to actually grant waivers. Another consular officer said 'the waiver process is fraud' and has 'no rational basis.' It's fair to ask whether Francisco misrepresented the waiver process. Strike 3. <br /> Roberts, in writing for the majority, parroted the Trump administration in vouching for the sanctity of the waiver process, which he says: <br /> On its face. This is precisely the 'window dressing' problem, as Justices Stephen Breyer and Sotomayor had noted in oral argument. It seems to be a facial facade, if you'll pardon the redundancy. <br /> Breyer and Sotomayor do not pull punches on this point in their dissents. Here's Breyer, in a dissent joined by Justice Elena Kagan: <br /> And here's Sotomayor's dissent, joined by Ginsburg: <br /> What's Roberts' response to these alarming facts and these warnings about a fraud being perpetrated on his court? A short, dismissive footnote: <br /> Does not affect our analysis. There are some footnotes in Supreme Court cases that live on famously, like Carolene Products Footnote 4, which, in the shadow of Jim Crow and the rise of Nazism, outlined an approach to equal protection and civil liberties that would eventually lead to Brown v. Board of Education and a generation of civil rights cases. I suspect that Roberts' travel ban Footnote 7 might live on infamously and come to define his court. <br /> Elsewhere in his opinion, Roberts bristles at the comparison to Korematsu, and understandably so. The truth hurts. In defending Japanese internment in the 1940s, the DOJ misled the court. Historian Peter Irons discovered this evidence in the 1980s, too late for the imprisoned plaintiffs, but not too late to make Charles Fahy notorious for his lies. As Irons wrote this month, the solicitor general 'knowingly misled the justices about the dangers of espionage and sabotage purportedly posed by members of this racial minority.' Fahy's assistant, Edward Ennis, found a Navy report stating, 'the entire 'Japanese Problem' has been magnified out of its true proportion (and) should be handled on the basis of the individual, and not on a racial basis.' Ennis warned Fahy that failing to disclose this report might constitute suppression of evidence, but Fahy still hid it as he argued that the internment orders were a matter of 'military necessity.' On appeal, Fahy hid other compelling evidence from the courts, assuring the court that 'not a single line, a single word, or a single syllable' in key reports undercut the military necessity of the internment. These were lies. <br /> Thanks to the power of Irons' research, federal judges overturned Korematsu's conviction in 1983. As the historian wrote this month: <br /> Has Solicitor General Francisco misled the Supreme Court and violated ethical obligations? It's too soon to know, but an investigation is necessary. The solicitor general is not just any lawyer representing a client. The position has been called the 10th justice, reflecting the office's historical role of aiding the court with a commitment to getting the law right. There are serious questions about whether Francisco has fulfilled that promise as solicitor general. <br /> And what about the fate and integrity of the Roberts court? Several of the justices who upheld the Japanese internment later redeemed themselves by striking down school segregation in Brown and pioneering an era of civil rights expansion. Roberts, along with four other justices, has been working to undo their work for most of his judicial career.His majority opinion upholding the travel ban is consistent with his anti-civil rights career. And if Kennedy retires this week, his mixed legacy on civil liberties will end on a shameful note, denying voting rights and ignoring evidence of bad-faith religious discrimination. The majority seemed genuinely concerned with anti-religious bias in Masterpiece Cakeshop, but the decision in Trump v. Hawaii suggests the Roberts court is concerned only with anti-Christian bias (see Hobby Lobby) as opposed to religious liberty generally. Finally, it is troubling that the majority ignored evidence of fraud and animus against Muslims at the border while the administration is in the midst of implementing a fraudulent and animus-driven border policy of family separation. <br /> Maybe these five justices will have a chance to redeem themselves if this case comes back after remand, and maybe they will find other ways to stand up for equality, civil liberties, and the rule of law as the Korematsu majority did later. But this week's injustice obviously is not a good sign."], "ID10" : ["nypost.com/2018/06/11/politicians-fear-for-safety-as-threats-against-congress-skyrocket", "Politicians fear for safety as threats against Congress skyrocket", "WASHINGTON - Rep. Barry Loudermilk of Georgia bought body armor. Rep. Gregg Harper hired armed security guards for events back home in Mississippi. And Rep. Dan Dovonan fortified his Brooklyn and Staten Island offices with security cameras and buzzer systems. <br /> This is the new normal for members of Congress. One year after the horrific congressional baseball shooting that almost took the life of Rep. Steve Scalise and former Hill staffer Matt Mika, members are keenly aware that serving in public office has put a target on their backs. <br /> 'The true reality is if somebody wanted to do me harm, they could probably do that with relative ease and that is sad,' said Rep. Chuck Fleishmann (R-Tenn.), a New York City native. <br /> The threats against them have skyrocketed. <br /> In 2016, there were 902 threatening incidents and communications against members of Congress. By 2017, the reports had more than doubled to about 2,000, according to the House Sergeant at Arms office. <br /> In response, the House Administration Committee allocated $25,000 to each member in 2017 and again in 2018 to beef up their personal and office security, prompting members to hire bodyguards for events and equip offices with panic buttons and shatter-resistant glass. <br /> The House Sergeant at Arms got an additional $5 million to improve office security for district offices. Congress also increased funding for Capitol Police by $29.2 million in 2017, and another $29.9 million in 2018. <br /> In recognition of the danger level, the Federal Election Commission also ruled in July that lawmakers can also use campaign funds -typically spent on TV ads and mailers - to install security systems at their homes. <br /> Harper, the chairman of the House Administration Committee that authorized security spending, said the shooting made clear that Congress needed to do more. <br /> 'What we would never want to have happen is for an incident to occur and anybody - a member, a visitor or staffer - to say you didn't give us what we needed to protect ourselves,' Harper said. <br /> Some members report feeling safer, but there are still barriers. <br /> Unchanged is that only the select members of leadership - five people out of 435 House members - are assigned security, including Scalise, whose heroic police officers fended off the baseball shooter last year. <br />  <br /> 'I'm trained at what I do and how I do it with a weapon,' said Rep. Mike Bishop (R-Mich.), who backs concealed carry reciprocity legislation. 'If I had the ability to carry, I would feel safer.' <br /> Bishop said the defenselessness became 'crystal clear when I hit the ground that day on that baseball field and realized that I had absolutely nothing to defend myself with against someone who had a weapon that he was double tapping on.' <br /> The 2011 shooting of Rep. Gabby Giffords in Arizona demonstrated the risks of public service, but the need for widespread security improvements were punctuated with the 2017 targeted attack on the Republican baseball team. <br /> On the morning of June 14, 2017, liberal activist James Hodgkinson opened fired at the Alexandria, Virginia, practice field. The bullets nearly cost Scalise and Mika their lives. Also injured were Zachary Barth, a congressional aide who was shot, Rep. Roger Williams, who injured his ankle and sustained shrapnel wounds, and two Capitol police officers, Crystal Griner and David Bailey. <br /> One year later, the GOP team will make a triumphant return to the charity baseball game on June 14 at Nationals Park in Washington. <br /> But unlike last year, they are practicing at a different - and heavily guarded - baseball field in Washington that The Post got to visit on the condition it was not identified. <br /> 'It was good to move from where we were,' said new team manager Williams (R-Texas), a former minor league baseball player and coach at Texas Christian University. 'A lot of us, including myself, did not want to go back there.' <br /> Williams said the return to baseball shows the strength of the country and determination of members to move past a terrible event, which 'for those us who were wounded (feels) it's like it was yesterday.' <br /> 'We're aware. We're not afraid,' Williams said. <br /> Since the baseball shooting, Loudermilk has been reminded regularly how perilous life is. <br /> Three months after the shooting in September, he got rear-ended off the road, flipping his vehicle several times. About a week after the car crash, a gunman shot at the car he was driving with his wife in the North Georgian mountains. Then he was on the Amtrak train Jan. 31 with other Republicans heading to a West Virginia retreat that hit a garbage truck, killing one person. <br /> 'Do I feel safer? No,' said Loudermilk, whose baseball practice clothes still have Mika's blood. 'Threats went up significantly. We have these - almost like wanted posters - in our district office of people who have made threats against me and my staff.' <br /> Some baseball players are still healing from the physical and emotional injuries from the trauma. They look to the remarkable recovery of Scalise and Mika as examples of fortitude. <br /> Mika, a former Adrian College baseball and football player, had volunteered to help out at GOP congressional team practice for about decade. The bullet wounds left him down and bleeding out on the practice field. A year later, his body is scarred, but he's back to the baseball field in high spirits and throwing balls in practice. <br /> 'I'm not a victim,' Mika, a lobbyist for Tyson foods, said. 'I'm a survivor.' <br /> Loudermilk, an Air Force veteran, had flashbacks for months after the shooting. He'd see Mika, on the brink of death. He knelt down in the pool of his blood and prayed, so Mika wouldn't die alone. <br /> 'He shouldn't be here today,' Loudermilk said. 'The grace of God on him and just the internal fortitude to live, that's what impressed me about him. He didn't die because he didn't want to.'"], "ID11" : ["https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/world/middleeast/gaza-israel-mortars.html", "Gaza Militants Barrage Israel With Mortars and Rockets", "JERUSALEM - Islamic militants in Gaza attacked southern Israel with rockets and mortars on Tuesday and Israel responded instantly with a wave of airstrikes across the Palestinian territory, a sharp escalation of violence after weeks of deadly protests, arson attacks and armed clashes along the border. <br /> The exchanges were the most intense cross-border hostilities in Gaza since the two sides fought a 50-day war in the summer of 2014. By 10 p.m. on Tuesday, Israel said there had been 70 rockets or mortars fired from Gaza throughout the day. <br /> The military wing of Hamas - the Islamic militant group that rules Gaza - claimed responsibility jointly with another faction, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Earlier in the day, it was initially assumed that Islamic Jihad was behind most of the attacks after Israel killed three of its members on Sunday. <br /> 'Bombing will be met by bombing and blood for blood,' the two groups said in the joint claim. <br /> Israel responded with airstrikes on 35 targets in Gaza after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel held Hamas responsible for the mortar attacks. Israel's Iron Dome antimissile system intercepted dozens of incoming projectiles, according to the military. <br /> Three soldiers and one civilian were injured on the Israeli side, but no fatalities were reported. <br /> Tensions have been spiraling along the border in recent weeks during a series of Palestinian protests against the 11-year blockade of the Gaza Strip and to press Palestinian claims to lands in what is now Israel. Israel insisted that it was not seeking to escalate, and that it was up to Hamas to decide whether to ratchet things up or stand down. <br /> 'Quiet will be met with quiet and violence with an appropriate response,' said Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman. But as he spoke, Israel's civil defense system was alerting its citizens to a fresh round of incoming rockets and more alerts followed. <br /> Late Tuesday, after a deluge of Israeli civil defense alerts about incoming fire from Gaza, Palestinian Islamic Jihad announced a cease-fire and credited Egyptian mediation for the deal. But Israel did not confirm such an agreement, and well after midnight the alerts of launchings from Gaza continued unabated. <br /> Early Wednesday, Israel announced a new wave of airstrikes against 25 more Hamas targets in Gaza, saying it was holding Hamas responsible for conducting and allowing a 'wide-scale attack against Israeli citizens.' <br /> The United States called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the latest attacks on Israel from Gaza and said it expected the session to be held on Wednesday afternoon. <br /> 'The recent attacks out of Gaza are the largest we have seen since 2014,' said the American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley. 'Mortars fired by Palestinian militants hit civilian infrastructure, including a kindergarten. The Security Council should be outraged and respond to this latest bout of violence directed at innocent Israeli civilians, and the Palestinian leadership needs to be held accountable for what they're allowing to happen in Gaza.' <br /> The Israeli military also said it had discovered and destroyed a U-shaped tunnel dug by Hamas from Gaza heading south into Egypt, then looping back north and extending about 900 yards into Israel. Colonel Conricus said the tunnel was intended for both smuggling and attacks and had been completed but not yet been put into use. <br /> One mortar shell fired Tuesday morning struck in the yard of a kindergarten in an Israeli border community shortly before preschoolers were to arrive. Television images showed the fortified walls of the kindergarten pockmarked with shrapnel and hunks of metal from the mortar shell jutting out of the sand in the playground. <br /> Soon after the initial barrage of 25 mortars, Israeli authorities announced a return to normal and schools and kindergartens in the area opened as usual, suggesting that the military was not expecting, or planning, an immediate escalation into a broader conflict. <br /> Half an hour later, however, sirens blared again as more mortar rounds were launched. That was followed by more sirens and more mortars. <br /> By afternoon, cellphones were buzzing with alerts of incoming rockets a few times an hour, and Colonel Conricus said local residents had been told not to stray more than a 15-second run from the nearest bomb shelter. <br /> 'In some cases over the last few hours, we've been able to provide 20 seconds of warning. But the current standard of warning is for 15 seconds,' he said. <br /> One of the rockets fired from Gaza hit a major supply line for electricity from Israel to Gaza and Israel's electric company said repairs would have to wait until it was safe for crews to work on it. That was expected to further reduce the sporadic electricity supply that already leaves Gazans without power for many hours a day. <br /> Suspicion for Tuesday's attacks initially fell on Islamic Jihad, an extremist group backed by Iran which sometimes rivals Hamas but sometimes works with the group against Israel. <br /> On Sunday, Israel shelled an Islamic Jihad observation post in southern Gaza, killing three members of the group. <br /> The Israeli military said it was a response to an explosive being planted the night before along the security fence dividing Gaza from Israel. The bomb, hidden in a pair of wire cutters, exploded as sappers neutralized it remotely. There were no injuries on the Israeli side. <br /> Islamic Jihad vowed to respond. Dawoud Shehab, a spokesman for the group, welcomed the mortar barrage, saying, 'Our Palestinian people's blood is not cheap.' <br /> Both Islamic Jihad and Hamas are heavily funded by Iran, the Israeli military noted, adding that the mortars used Tuesday were standard Iranian munitions. But officials stopped short of accusing Iran of ordering the attack. <br /> Experts said that there was ample room for the two sides to return to a standoff after Tuesday's fighting, but that a different outcome of the morning's mortar attack could have tied Israel's hands. <br /> Amos Harel, the military affairs analyst for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, said if the mortar had struck near the kindergarten half an hour later, it would likely have led to a major Israeli campaign. <br /> 'If we had, God forbid, two or three kids dying there, then the public reaction and political reaction would have been much different and we may have been facing a larger Israeli operation, even a ground operation in Gaza right now,' he said. <br /> Mr. Netanyahu met late Tuesday with the defense minister and the army chief of staff. <br /> 'Israel views harshly the attacks against it and its communities by Hamas and Islamic Jihad from Gaza,' the prime minister said earlier in the day. 'Israel will exact a heavy price from whoever tries to harm it and we view Hamas as bearing the responsibility for preventing such attacks against us.' <br /> The United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, Nickolay E. Mladenov, condemned the barrage of fire out of Gaza. <br /> 'Such attacks are unacceptable and undermine the serious efforts by the international community to improve the situation in Gaza,' he said. 'All parties must exercise restraint, avoid escalation and prevent incidents that jeopardize the lives of Palestinians and Israelis.' <br /> As many as 120 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since March 30, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, mostly by snipers during the protests and half of them in a single day, May 14, the peak of the campaign. <br /> The May 14 protests were timed to coincide with the opening of the United States Embassy in Jerusalem and came on the eve of the 70th anniversary of what Palestinians call the nakba, or catastrophe, referring to the war surrounding Israel's establishment in 1948. <br /> Israel said it was defending its border and the nearby communities against a mass breach by the protesters, adding that Gaza militants intended to use unarmed civilian protesters as cover to infiltrate Israeli territory and attack Israeli soldiers and civilians. <br /> Palestinians have also sent incendiary kites and balloons over the border fence from Gaza, setting hundreds of fires in the fields and forest on the Israeli side. <br /> Over the weekend, a small group of Palestinians cut through the fence and set fire to an empty Israeli military post. Israeli fighter jets struck a Hamas military compound in response. And late Monday, heavy machine-gun fire from Gaza hit buildings in the Israeli border town of Sderot. <br /> Tuesday's hostilities extended not just below and above ground, but out to sea. A Hamas boat carrying people needing medical attention attempted to run the Israeli naval blockade of Gaza and head to Cyprus. But it was stopped and the boat was towed to the Israeli port city of Ashdod without any harm to the 17 people aboard, Israel said."], "ID12" : ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-fires-back-at-trump-with-tariffs-on-106-us-products-including-soybeans-cars/2018/04/04/338134f4-37d8-11e8-b57c-9445cc4dfa5e_story.html", "Trump pushes back on fears of a trade war with China", "President Trump showed no sign Wednesday of backing down from an escalating trade confrontation with China, even as financial markets wobbled and American farmers and manufacturers warned that he was inviting a damaging commercial clash. <br /> Hours after the Chinese government announced plans to match the president's tariffs on $50 billion in imported Chinese goods with import levies on U.S. soybeans, cars and airplanes, Trump fired off a bellicose tweet. <br /> 'When you're already $500 Billion DOWN, you can't lose!' the president wrote, in reference to the 2016 U.S. deficit in goods and services trade. <br /> Other administration officials hinted that the trade dispute ultimately may be settled at the bargaining table. <br /> Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross called the investor reaction overblown and signaled that the administration may seek to resolve the trade dispute through diplomacy. 'Even shooting wars end with negotiations,' Ross told CNBC. 'So it wouldn't be surprising at all if the net outcome of all this is some sort of negotiation, whether it happens by May or some other time, that's another whole question.' <br /> But Wall Street was rattled by the exchange of blows between the world's two largest economies. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 500 points in early trading before rebounding and closing up more than 230 points, or nearly 1 percent. Soybean prices plunged more than 5 percent as traders grappled with the possible closure of a market that bought roughly half of U.S. exports of the commodity last year. <br /> Farm groups Wednesday joined the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers in opposing the president's reliance on tariffs as a tool to change Chinese industrial policies. The administration wants China to stop forcing U.S. companies to share their technology with Chinese partners, using cybertheft to gain trade secrets, and acquiring U.S. high-tech companies in the open market. <br /> Former senator Max Baucus, who co-chairs Farmers for Free Trade, said the Chinese tariffs will hurt 'harvesters, processors, truck drivers, rail workers, and main street businesses that rely on a strong agricultural economy' along with farmers. <br /> 'We urge the administration to reconsider escalating this trade war,' said Baucus, who represented Montana in the Senate and later served as President Barack Obama's ambassador to China. <br /> Once imposed, the Chinese measures are not expected to have a significant impact on the broader U.S. economy. 'In isolation, 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of goods is not a big deal from a macro perspective - [it] adds less than 0.1 percent to the cost structure of the economy,' said economist Jim O'Sullivan of High-Frequency Economics. 'The issue is whether there is retaliation to the retaliation and so on.' <br /> Business groups such as the National Association of Manufacturers have urged the administration to pursue negotiations rather than swap tariff hikes with the Chinese.

Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative, negotiated such accords with Japan in the 1980s as a Reagan administration official. <br /> Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said late last month that he was 'hopeful' the sides could hammer out an accommodation on trade. But U.S. officials have disclosed no plans for formal talks, and a spokesman for Mnuchin  did not respond to telephone and email requests for comment. <br /> 'We hope now that the two sides can avoid further escalation and get to the table to try to negotiate something,' said Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents companies such as General Motors and Walmart. 'Our fear is this is not a great environment to compromise and do what a negotiation requires.' <br /> Hopes that a diplomatic resolution can avert a full-blown trade war are clouded by doubts over the administration's strategy and goals. <br /> 'The lack of a clear end game heightens the risk that this conflict could escalate,' said Eswar Prasad, former head of the International Monetary Fund's China division. 'This is going to get a lot uglier before it gets any better.' <br /> Trump targets $50 billion in Chinese electronics, aerospace with tariffs <br /> Trump is threatening to impose tariffs unless China abandons a host of policies aimed at vacuuming up American technology, including foreign ownership restrictions, state-backed investments in Silicon Valley and -cybertheft. <br /> U.S. Trade Representative officials say those structural pillars of China's state-led economy put U.S. companies at a disadvantage in the Chinese market and erode the United States's global technology lead. <br /> But the president remains fixated on shrinking the $375 billion deficit in U.S. goods trade with China, which he asked Chinese officials last month to narrow by $100 billion. The U.S. trade gap with China is 'the largest deficit of any country in the history of our world,' the president complained last month while previewing his tariff offensive. <br /> 'The U.S. has perhaps mis-messaged the whole exercise by drawing so much attention to the deficit rather than emphasizing the fundamental matters,' said Simona Mocuta, senior economist at State Street Global Advisors. <br /> U.S. concerns over China's mercantilist policies are widely shared by China's other trading partners, including the European Union and Japan. But persuading Chinese President Xi Jinping to temper his drive to overtake more technologically advanced economies is likely to require united action with U.S. allies. <br /> And Trump irked those countries by first threatening them with a separate wave of tariffs before moving against China. <br /> 'I wish they would spend more time and effort coordinating with others. It's more effective with China when you can do that,' said Dennis Wilder, the CIA's -former deputy assistant director for East Asia and the Pacific. 'Had we coordinated better, the pressure could have been larger on the Chinese.' <br /> Chinese officials are ready to bargain over some items on the U.S. wish list, though revising their key industrial policies probably would not happen any time soon, he said. In the short run, China might address Trump's concerns over the trade deficit by lowering its 25 percent tariff on imported automobiles and accelerating purchases of major American products, such as Boeing aircraft, he said. <br /> Officials in Beijing, however, complain that as the Trump administration intensified its complaints about China's trade practices in recent weeks, it remained unclear who is the administration's lead negotiator, said Wilder, the managing director for a U.S.-China dialogue under the auspices of Georgetown University, who was in Beijing last week. <br /> Mnuchin has recently corresponded with China's vice premier, Liu He, about trade issues, which are Lighthizer's purview. <br /> How trade wars end - and why Trump's will be different <br /> 'They will be looking for the administration's bottom line. What the Chinese tell me is the administration won't tell them what is their bottom line,' Wilder said. 'I see the real negotiation starting now.' <br /> Administration officials reject the criticism about confusing signals. In their view, U.S. officials have repeatedly raised complaints over unfair Chinese practices with the government in Beijing, only to receive lip service rather than tangible change. Since 2010, the Chinese government has pledged at least eight times to stop requiring foreign companies to hand over their technology in return for market access, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. <br /> 'It's very easy to get them to promise to do things. It's much harder to get them to actually do things,' said a USTR official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to brief reporters on the administration's thinking. <br /> The official would not answer questions about potential negotiations. But there is a negotiating window available, if the administration chooses to use it. <br /> The U.S. tariffs will not take effect for weeks or months after the end on May 22 of a public comment period. After that, Lighthizer has until Aug. 18 to finalize the tariff list. Though the president is unlikely to dawdle, he could in theory wait an additional 180 days beyond that date to impose the tariffs. <br /> Earlier Wednesday, the president blamed his predecessors for the lopsided U.S.-China trade relationship. 'We are not in a trade war with China, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the U.S. Now we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year, with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion. We cannot let this continue!' he tweeted. <br /> China's retort to Trump's latest trade move was pretty clever <br /> In a U.S.-China trade war, Trump voters likely get hurt the most <br /> The U.S. wrote the rules for trade.

There is perhaps no purer form of politics than a leadership race in the U.S. House of Representatives. <br /> Members trade varying forms of support for other favors. They box out other competitors from running. And, in the case of conservative Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), they delicately put themselves forward to angle for something else. <br /> Jordan said Friday morning that while 'there is no speaker's race right now,' if there was one, he's been 'urged by colleagues' to 'consider' running and is 'definitely open to that.' <br /> Jordan, the first chairman of the meddlesome Freedom Caucus, almost certainly will never be Speaker of the House. The speaker needs 218 public votes on the floor, and it's difficult to see Jordan ever getting there. But posturing now to throw his hat in the ring likely isn't about winning that race. Instead, Jordan and other conservatives may be setting themselves up to stymie any other candidate and potentially make a deal for another position ? or, at least, get other concessions. <br /> The dream scenario for conservatives is that in exchange for supporting a speaker they receive support for Jordan as majority leader. The two candidates would then run as a [outlet], potentially picking up the endorsement of President Donald Trump along the way, and pushing through both Republicans. While the speaker needs a majority of the whole House, the leader only needs a majority of Republicans behind closed doors, and conservatives believe Jordan could get there with the right pressure from the right people. <br /> That demand might still be a little too ambitious, however, particularly if the Freedom Caucus only ends up holding a few dozen votes. The very fact that Jordan is now publicly putting himself out there suggests there isn't yet any deal between Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) ? the natural heir to replace retiring Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) as speaker ? and the Freedom Caucus. And McCarthy may not be all that interested in a speakership where Jordan is the majority leader setting the floor agenda. <br /> Either way, even if they don't get their first ask, conservatives could still negotiate to get other demands, like proportional representation on more desired committees or procedural reforms. But ultimately their hand is only as strong as the number of votes they hold. <br /> Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) did mention Friday that he was confident no one currently has the votes to become speaker. 'So anybody who says, well, this person can't be speaker, or that one, there is no one in this body who could be speaker other than Speaker Ryan,' Meadows said. <br /> But conservatives aren't the only ones banking on no one being able to get to 218 votes. <br /> The whole strategy from Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) seems to be to wait and let McCarthy falter in his quest to get a majority of the House, at which point Scalise could ride in and save the GOP conference from itself ? a scenario that played out two and a half years ago when McCarthy dropped out of the speaker's race and Ryan entered the fray. <br /> That strategy has its own problems though, especially if McCarthy were to get within striking distance of the number. Scalise may believe the Freedom Caucus and his own loyalists can block McCarthy from getting the numbers, but Scalise is already getting backed into supporting McCarthy for speaker himself, and if the Freedom Caucus cut a deal with McCarthy for Jordan to take the leader spot, it's not unimaginable that McCarthy and Jordan ? both of whom are close with Trump ? could get the president to pressure Ryan out sooner rather than later. <br /> In that sense, the deal conservatives may be offering to McCarthy might be an enticing one. He could likely ascend to the speakership now and take his chances in November that Republicans hold the House. <br /> Of course, if Republicans lose the House, which is a distinct possibility, McCarthy's reign could be very short-lived, and Republicans would be setting themselves up for an even more ugly leadership race. But that's just one of the risks involved in this ploy. <br /> If everything goes the way Ryan has laid out ? where he remains speaker through the elections and until the end of this Congress ? Republicans will get to see if they retain control of the majority and whether they need to have a speaker race. But even then, Jordan's gambit could pay off. Conservatives believe Republicans may want a more fiery minority leader if they lose the majority, and though Jordan would certainly have trouble winning that race, conservatives are interested in seeing the mood of the conference then. <br /> Asked Friday whether Republicans may want a different person to be speaker than they would minority leader, Jordan said, 'Who knows?' <br /> Jordan did deny that his shadow candidacy may be about leverage. 'That's not the point, that's not the focus, that's not even a question that should be asked at this moment,' he said. <br /> But it's hard to believe Jordan when the Freedom Caucus has shown for years that they have a knack for these sorts of tactical situations. <br /> When [outlet] asked Meadows Friday what he'd say to people who think Jordan's candidacy is just about leverage for the Freedom Caucus, Meadows said those people would be thinking 'there is a whole lot more strategy to members of Congress than what I've evidenced in the last six years.' <br /> 'How's that?' he then asked, making sure his quote would suffice. <br /> Do you have information you want to share with [outlet]?

Charles told me the way he hoped to go when his time came. His dream, he said, was to be assassinated during the seventh-inning stretch at a game at Nationals Park. He wanted to die in what he once called 'my own private paradise,' where 'the twilight's gleaming, the popcorn's popping, the kids're romping and everyone's happy.' <br /> Alas, fate has different plans. Charles's announcement that he has only a few weeks to live is heartbreaking. But in writing it, he gave all who love and admire him a wonderful gift - the opportunity to tell him what he means to us and how he changed our lives. <br /> Charles was the first person I turned to for advice when I was offered the opportunity to write a weekly column for The Post. I did not know him at the time. Like so many others, I had long admired his work from afar. The first time I saw him speak in person was in 2004, when I was a young Pentagon speechwriter and Charles gave the American Enterprise Institute's Irving Kristol <br /><br /><br />Award<br /> lecture. He was introduced by Vice President Dick Cheney, who noted that Charles had been a speechwriter for one of his predecessors. 'I now wish I had paid more attention at the time to the speeches of Walter Mondale,' Cheney said. <br /> Charles delivered an enthralling lecture, which<br />, to this day, is the best expression I have ever heard of America's role in the world. He dismissed the idea of American empire, declaring, 'It is absurd to apply the word to a people whose first instinct upon arriving on anyone's soil is to demand an exit strategy.' Unlike Rome or Britain or other classical empires, he said, Americans do not hunger for territory. 'We like it here. We like our McDonald's. We like our football. We like our rock-and-roll. We've got the Grand Canyon and Graceland. .?.?. We've got everything. And if that's not enough, we've got Vegas - which is a facsimile of everything. .?.?. If we want Chinese or Indian or Italian, we go to the food court.' <br /> We are not an imperial power, Charles said, but a commercial republic that, 'by pure accident of history, has been designated custodian of the international system.' How to meet those responsibilities? Charles systematically took apart the competing schools of foreign policy: isolationism (which he called an 'ideology of fear'); liberal internationalism (which supports force only in cases 'devoid of national interest' and seeks to constrain American power through 'fictional legalisms'); and realism (which believes in American power but 'fails because it offers no vision'). <br /> In their place, Charles offered what he called democratic realism, which 'sees as the engine of history not the will to power, but the will to freedom.' America, he said, 'will support democracy everywhere, but we will commit blood and treasure only in places where there is a strategic necessity.' Put another way, he said, we will intervene 'where it counts.' Germany and Japan counted. So did the Soviet Union. So does the battle against Islamic totalitarianism. <br /> I realized that night: That's not only what I think; that's how I want to think. That's how I want to write. I want to be like Charles Krauthammer. <br /> A few years later, when I asked his advice for my new Post column, Charles invited me to his office. What a thrill to finally meet him in person! He was exactly as I expected: gracious, funny and kind. He shared with me his writing process, how he came up with ideas and wrote - and rewrote - his columns, until every word was perfect. And then he gave me one last piece of advice. 'One day, they are going to ask you to write two columns a week,' he said. 'Don't do it. No one can write two good columns a week.' I followed his advice .?.?. until this year. (Sorry, Charles). <br /> In the years that followed, I was blessed to spend countless hours with Charles waiting to go on the air at [outlet], talking about everything from conservative philosophy to the rise of President Trump. He is so brilliant, so immersed in the debate, that he has never needed to prepare very much. One day, I asked him what his topic was. 'I have no idea,' he said with a twinkle in his eye. I had to spend hours preparing to be half as good as Charles. I'm still working on it.

Written by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, is was intended to rebut a Republican document made public last week with Trump's consent. <br /> The memo by committee Republicans claimed bias against Trump by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Justice Department in the federal investigation of Russia and the 2016 U.S. election. <br /> The Intelligence Committee had voted unanimously on Monday to release the document drafted by the panel's Democrats, contingent on the Republican president agreeing. <br /> 'The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew, because of sources and methods (and more), would have to be heavily redacted, whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency,' Trump tweeted. 'Told them to re-do and send back in proper form!' <br /> Trump's decision to block the release of the memo infuriated Democrats, who said it showed a double standard on transparency on the part of the Republican president. <br /> Representative Adam Schiff, the senior Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said in a statement on Saturday that he will review redactions recommended by the FBI and Justice Department. <br /> 'We hope this matter can be quickly resolved so the committee can return to its charge - fully investigating the Russian interference in our election and the role of the Trump campaign, and what steps need to be taken to protect against foreign interference in the next election, now only months away,' Schiff said. <br /> He was referring to November's U.S. elections in which all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and 34 of 100 Senate seats are in play. Currently, Republicans hold majorities in both chambers. Democrats hope Trump's low popularity in public opinion polls will help them win majorities, and some analysts give them a good chance. <br /> House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, in a statement posted on Twitter, called on Democrats to accept the Justice Department's recommendations and 'make the appropriate technical changes and redactions' so that the memo can be declassified as soon as possible. <br /> Trump on Feb. 2 allowed the release of the Republican document with no redactions, even though the Justice Department and FBI argued against making it public. The FBI expressed 'grave concerns about material omissions of fact' in the Republic memo. <br /> Democrats said it mischaracterized highly sensitive classified information and was intended to discredit special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of potential collusion between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia. <br /> Trump repeatedly has denied any such collusion. <br /> Late on Friday, Senator Dianne Feinstein, a senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, accused Trump of 'hypocrisy at its worst' in blocking, at least for now, release of the House Democrats' memo. <br /> 'Any minor redactions should be made as quickly as possible and the memo should be released,' she said. <br /> (Reporting by Yeganeh Torbati; Writing by Richard Cowan; Editing by Bill Trott and DAvid Gregorio) <br /> Do you have information you want to share with [outlet]?

We always hear the same refrain from both sides: that people are suffering and living in the shadows; that we must find a solution for them as well as a way to solidify our border security. And yet nothing ever gets done. <br /> The impression of some in the press seems to be that nothing gets done because of a lack of public pressure. If only they could somehow jar American sensibilities into solving this problem once and for all! <br /> Certainly, that's the motivation that lies behind the sudden media enthusiasm for covering the phenomenon of Immigration and Customs Enforcement separating children from their illegal-immigrant parents at the border. For the last week, the attention has been nearly wall-to-wall - and the moral preening has hit an all-time apex. [outlet] is now analyzing Biblical verses while asking, 'What Would Jesus Do?' (Does this mean Trump has finally won the War on Christmas?) Chuck Todd of NBC News is accusing Republicans of holding kids 'hostage.' Media members are breaking land-speed records to rush down to the border in order to shout their outrage over the holding pens in which the authorities are holding small children. <br /> Presumably, all of this is designed to effectuate change. <br /> Instead, it achieves precisely the opposite. <br /> That's because the media coverage of the illegal-immigration issue has always been shot through with emotionally manipulative falsehoods. In this case, that manipulation has been particularly extreme. <br /> We've heard that the Trump administration has heartlessly sought to rip toddlers from the arms of their weeping mothers in order to punish illegal-immigrant parents who are merely seeking asylum. But the truth is more complex: The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that even accompanied immigrant minors must be released from custody within 20 days. That means that if their parents do not arrive at a point of entry to claim asylum, and instead violate the law by crossing the border illegally, they will be arrested - and their children must then be separated from them by the working of the law. The only possible solution, without a change to the law itself, would involve releasing illegal-immigrant parents along with their children into the general population. <br /> We've also heard about the terrible living conditions in the holding centers for these children. Likely, some of that is true - although the stories from various sources conflict. But those facilities were overburdened for years before Trump took office; in fact, the media covered these same facilities and pointed out the problems therein during the Obama administration. In other words, this isn't a Trumpian attempt to dump kids in hellholes. It's a longtime problem that has yet to be solved. <br /> In reality, all of this could be solved with simple legislation. The House of Representatives is actually set to take up the issue of family separation in both versions of the immigration bill being presented in the House. But Democrats probably won't sign on to either bill - and it's unlikely they'd even sign onto an independent piece of legislation designed to allow children to stay with their illegal-immigrant parents until their cases can be adjudicated. That's because thanks to biased media coverage - and, in some cases, outright falsehoods - Democrats are winning the public-relations war. The longer the Democrats prevent a solution from arising, the more they gain in the public-opinion polls. So they have little incentive to come to the table around an immigration solution - their better political option remains to wait Trump out and let the press inflict damage on him. There's a reason every Republican attempt at immigration reform has stalled out over the past two decades - and there's a reason Democrats have celebrated every time they have. There's also a reason that Democrats with unified control of the presidency and Congress attempted no serious immigration reform. Better to let the problem fester for political gain than to attempt to solve it. <br /> If the media truly wished to contribute to a solution, all they'd have to do is cover the issue honestly. Yes, Trump is enforcing the laws against crossing the border illegally more harshly than the Obama administration did. But he didn't create the separation policy. Yes, Trump has spoken with great passion in favor of stronger border controls. But he's also offered a bigger amnesty for so-called DREAMers than even Barack Obama did. <br /> Instead of using truth as a guide, however, the press continue to suggest that base animus animates conservative feelings on immigration. This leads to a political prisoner's dilemma in which everyone's best option is stasis: Republicans are best off doing nothing, since they'll earn nothing but scorn for any action they take from the press anyway, as well as the undying enmity of many in their base; Democrats are best off doing nothing, since they can count on the press to clock Republicans for any immigration failures.

Many had never faced arrest before. But here they were. <br /> Capitol Police said 575 protesters were arrested and escorted out of the Hart Senate Office Building in a mass demonstration that called for the abolishment of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, and an end to migrant family detentions and the Trump administration's 'zero tolerance' immigration policy. <br /> They were charged with unlawfully demonstrating, a misdemeanor. <br /> 'I have two kids, and as a white mother, there is almost no circumstance that they would be taken away from me - ever,' said Victoria Farris, who slept Wednesday night in All Souls Church after participating in civil disobedience training. 'I was awake one night because I couldn't sleep thinking about all those [immigrant] mothers and terrified children. I realized I had to do something more than protest, more than make a sign and march.' <br /> Protesters unfurled banners inside the Hart building Thursday as others staged a sit-in, wrapping themselves in shiny, silver space blankets. The political banners, which aren't allowed in the building's lobby, were confiscated by police. <br /> Then the arrests began. <br /> Just after 3 p.m., protesters were rounded up in groups of a dozen or more and led out of the building. <br /> 'Abolish ICE,' they shouted as more were moved out. 'Shut it down.' <br /> Demonstrators continued to sing and chant as they were led away. <br /> Seeking split from ICE, agents say Trump's immigration crackdown hurts investigations, morale <br /> When the first group was escorted out of the building, the remaining crowd erupted in cheers. <br /> As police continued to clear the area, several senators greeted demonstrators, including  Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.). <br /> 'I join them in calling on the Trump administration to reunite these families and give these kids back to their parents,' Duckworth said. 'On my side of things, I ask my colleagues, let's pass, finally, sensible immigration reform.' <br /> Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) joined in the protest and was led out with marchers by Capitol Police. Actress Susan Sarandon, who marched at the front as the protest made its way down Constitution Avenue, was arrested with a group of demonstrators. <br /> It took about an hour to clear the women from the building. <br /> The protest began hours earlier at Freedom Plaza, where hundreds of women robed in white and carrying signs deriding the Trump administration's immigration policy had gathered. The protest was organized by a coalition of groups, including the Women's March and the immigrant advocacy organization Casa de Maryland. <br /> Several participants wrote 'WE CARE' on their palms, a rebuke of the jacket first lady Melania Trump wore on her first trip to visit detained children near the border. <br /> Ana Maria Archila, executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy, said calling for the disbandment of ICE 'would have seemed absurd even a few months ago.' <br /> But now it is central to the mission of her group and Thursday's march. <br /> 'This country has finally been exposed to the brutality and inhumanity of immigration enforcement,' she said. 'This barrage of injustices has inspired us to say, 'No more. We will not be silent. We will not obey.'?' <br /> After gathering at Freedom Plaza, the group marched to the Justice Department before heading to the Hart building, singing hymns and protest songs all the way. <br /> As they marched along Pennsylvania Avenue, past the Trump International Hotel, the crowd began to chant, 'Shame,' then burst into boos and demanded, 'Where are the children?' <br /> Approaching the Justice Department, the group fell silent, raising fists and hands in the air. Several federal workers on a lunch break wandered over to the fringe of the protest, taking pictures and clapping as the group of white-clad women walked on. <br /> When they reached the front of the Justice Department, hundreds crowded the street and sat. Police cars blocked the area as officers allowed the sit-in to proceed. Several drivers who were able to squeeze by honked and gestured in solidarity. <br /> In the Hart building, onlookers cheered as the women sang and chanted. Senate staff members in one office held a pink sign in the window: 'Feminists are the majority.' <br /> The Trump administration's immigration crackdown hit resistance this week after the House rejected a border bill championed by the president, and a federal judge ordered the government to reunite immigrant families within a month. <br /> But organizers said that has done little to abate national outrage. Thursday's march was one of several D.C. demonstrations this week to rebuke Trump's immigration policies. <br /> 'Quit your jobs': Protesters confront ICE workers at Washington headquarters <br /> On Wednesday, dozens of activists, including several who were recipients of the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which gives temporary protection to immigrants illegally brought into the country as children, rallied outside the Washington headquarters of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and called for the organization's dissolution. They shouted at police and implored workers peering out the windows to 'quit your job.' <br /> Thousands of demonstrators are expected to descend on Lafayette Square on Saturday in a protest calling for the end of family detentions and the return of the at least 2,500 children who were separated from their parents at the southern border.

As hundreds of thousands of Americans join protests to press for change in the Trump era, the history of this sit-in movement offers powerful lessons. <br /> The four men, all first-year students at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College, were refused service at the lunch counter, which like most chain store lunch counters in the South had a whites-only policy. They stayed on their stools until closing. They repeated the routine the next day and the day after that, each time with more and more classmates. <br /> More: Trump abuses show we must turn traditions into laws: Bharara and Whitman <br /> More: On Trump 'travel ban,' Japanese American internment is a cautionary tale <br /> Within days, the protest had expanded to other Greensboro lunch counters and hundreds were taking part. Students in other Southern cities learned what was happening and started their own demonstrations, and in just weeks, lunch counter sit-ins were taking place across the South. By the end of the spring, tens of thousands of black college and high school students, along with some white students, had joined the protests. <br /> The sit-in movement energized and transformed the struggle for racial equality. It moved the struggle's front lines from courtrooms and legislatures to the streets, and it had a younger generation of activists as its leaders. It set in motion a chain of events that would culminate in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned racial discrimination in public accommodations across the nation. <br /> Each protest is a unique response to unique circumstances. Protests that look like they can never succeed end up achieving great things, while protests that look like they can't fail do just that. Nonetheless, the sit-ins worked spectacularly well; it's worth considering why. <br /> We are told that certain iconic protest campaigns of the civil rights movement polled poorly (true) or that Martin Luther King faced widespread condemnation at certain points in his career (also true). To be sure, bold protests that attract attention, even if most of it is condemnatory, can play a critical role in creating the conditions for political change. But there is no getting around the fact that at some point, change requires convincing people who are not already on your side. <br /> 'It's easy to get people's attention,' explained A. Philip Randolph, one of the black freedom struggle's greatest strategists. 'What counts is getting their interest.' <br /> The sit-ins did just this. They presented hundreds of public displays - multiplied through news coverage - of youthful resistance that awakened ignorant or apathetic white Americans to raw and dignity-sapping daily discrimination. The protests generated statements of support from national political, religious and business leaders. White college students outside the South launched sympathy demonstrations, boycotting national chains that allowed racial discrimination in their Southern stores. <br /> There were critics, of course. Die-hard segregationists were unimpressed. People attacked the protests for undermining property rights of business operators. Yet even some segregationists were forced to recognize the power of the sit-ins. Richmond newspaper editor James Kilpatrick confessed that watching a 'ragtail rabble' of white boys waving the 'proud and honored flag of the Southern states' while heckling 'colored students, in coats, white shirts, ties' - one reading Goethe, no less - gave him 'pause.' <br /> One reason the lunch counter sit-in movement was so successful was that it created so many ways for the protesters to win. For many, simply taking part in a sit-in could be a triumph. Students often talked about the sense of pride and dignity being part of a sit-in gave them. <br /> Whites who held the levers of power in the segregated South had to respond to the protests. And this gave the protesters a sense of empowerment. When the Greensboro Woolworth manager shut down his lunch counter, students marched back to campus, chanting, 'It's all over!' and 'We whipped Woolworth!' <br /> More: Dreamers aren't going to be safe from the law without a DACA agreement <br /> POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media <br /> Changing a single person's mind could be a victory. When participants were asked what they hoped to get out of their protests, a common answer was quite simple: To be served. 'We don't want brotherhood,' one activist declared. 'We just want a cup of coffee - sitting down.' <br /> And a growing number of eating facilities desegregated in the face of the protests. Within seven months of the first Greensboro sit-in, 27 Southern cities had integrated their lunch counters. Each one was a victory. <br /> The sit-ins offered the kinds of attainable achievements that energized the movement, that got protesters back out the next day and the day after that. At the same time, the sit-ins had the kind of aspirational goals that give larger meaning to the sacrifice and risk of the protest. <br /> Students often spoke of their desire for 'first-class citizenship.' The real objective of the sit-ins, explained racial justice activist Ella Baker, was 'to rid America of the scourge of racial segregation and discrimination - not only at lunch counters, but in every aspect of life.' <br /> Once again, we could be on the cusp of a rare moment in which social protest and political activism converge to create lasting political and legal change. The lunch counter sit-in movement of 1960 provides an inspiring example of how this can be done. <br /> Christopher W.

McCabe has often been a target of President Trump - who asked the deputy director in a private discussion whom he had voted for in the presidential election - and congressional Republicans, who have criticized the FBI for its Russia probe. He will use leave time to fill out his remaining time at the agency. <br /> Here's what we know about Bowdich: <br /> He began his career as a police officer in New Mexico <br /> The Albuquerque native graduated from New Mexico State University in 1991. He worked as an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department from 1991 to 1995, patrolling the Southeast and North Valley area commands, according to the Albuquerque Journal. He also worked as a detective during his time in the North Valley. <br /> 'He was very ambitious, very smart and very physically fit,' Deputy Police Chief Robert Huntsman told the Albuquerque Journal. Huntsman was a sergeant when Bowdich was a cadet at the police academy. <br /> 'He was an informal leader for the other cadets,' Huntsman said. <br /> Trump asked the acting FBI director how he voted during Oval Office meeting <br /> He's a former FBI SWAT team member and sniper <br /> Bowdich joined the FBI in 1995 as a special agent and served as a SWAT team member and sniper at the agency's San Diego field office. There, he investigated violent crimes and gangs, according to an FBI news release. <br /> One of his investigations included a year-long wiretap that resulted in the first federal criminal racketeering convictions brought against a street gang in Southern California, according to FBI officials. In 2005, he started leading a multiagency gang task force that through undercover operations and wiretaps investigated drug and racketeering cases against the Mexican Mafia, Bloods and Crips gangs and the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club, FBI officials said. <br /> He oversaw non-white-collar crime investigations at the FBI's San Diego field office . . . <br /> In 2009, Bowdich became the assistant special agent in charge of the bureau's San Diego office. In that role, he identified the emerging kidnapping trend of Mexican cartel-related groups and, in response, created the country's first FBI squad to pinpoint kidnapping threats on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. <br /> That squad brought cases against 43 cartel members and associates who ran multiple kidnapping cells in the San Diego area, according to FBI officials. <br /> Bowdich also oversaw the investigation of the deaths of two U.S. Border Patrol agents killed in the line of duty. <br /> . . . and later ran the Los Angeles field office <br /> In 2014, he was named the assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office - overseeing seven Southern California counties with a population of nearly 19 million people, according to Los Angeles Times. <br /> He talked to longtime writer and columnist Patt Morrison in 2015 about how federal agencies had to change after the 9/11 attacks. 'Former Director [Robert] Mueller told the story about how he went to see President Bush right after 9/11. He began to tell him all the resources in place at the Pentagon; the World Trade Center; in Shanksville, Pa; and President Bush puts up his hand and says, 'I got it. What are we doing to stop the next one?' And that was the sea change the FBI had to make.' <br /> A Trump spokesman's revealing comments about Andrew McCabe, hours before McCabe quit the FBI <br /> In L.A., he was on alert for the possibility of a terrorist attack months before the San Bernardino mass shooting <br /> In February 2015, Bowdich told Los Angeles Times's Morrison that he believed Southern California was a potential terrorist target. He cited a conversation he had at the time with William J. Bratton, who was then police commissioner in New York City. <br /> '[Bratton] said New York is focused on terrorism because they've been hit. Their memory is very long. And they've had several plots that have been disrupted since,' Bowdich told the Times. 'Los Angeles is a big, big city, and we have some iconic potential targets. My concern is that we not become complacent, because complacency is very dangerous.' <br /> He added that people had a responsibility to report concerning messages on social media or suspicious behavior. <br /> 'People have a right to say what they want, but if it appears they're getting ready to go fight or conduct some sort of attack, those are a concern,' he said. <br /> He led the FBI response to the San Bernardino shooting <br /> After the December 2015 terrorist attack in San Bernardino that killed 14 people and wounded 22 others, Bowdich asked the public at a January 2016 news conference for help in figuring out whether the husband and wife behind the attack - Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik - had communicated with anyone after the shooting. An 18-minute period after the shooting, from 12:59 p.m. to 1:17 p.m., puzzled investigators, who wondered if Farook and Malik went to a home or business or contacted anyone else. <br /> Using traffic cameras, surveillance footage and witness accounts, Bowdich and investigators had already pieced together what Farook and Malik were doing in the four hours before the shooting, The Post's Mark Berman reported at the time. And investigators knew that about 45 minutes after the shooting the couple visited the city's Lake Seccombe. Divers were dispatched into the water to see what they could recover, but none of the items they found appeared to be relevant to the investigation, the FBI said. <br /> Bowdich, who at the time still ran the FBI's Los Angeles office, told reporters then that 'until we close that gap, we just don't know for sure.' <br /> He later told Los Angeles Times that the husband and wife intended to detonate a pipe bomb hidden inside a bag at the Inland Regional Center, where the shooting took place. <br /> His favorite cops-and-robbers movie is 'The Untouchables' <br /> 'Eliot Ness' character was unyielding, tenacious, principled,' he told the Times's Morrison.

The memo makes the disputed claim that high-ranking FBI and Justice Department officials failed to disclose that information cited in their Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act application came from a partisan source. <br /> Partisans' reactions to the memo largely mirror their pre-existing feelings about the bureau itself. Of those Trump voters who've heard about the memo, 79 percent think it shows that the FBI did something wrong, and more than 80 percent describe the memo's contents as accurate. <br /> By contrast, although Hillary Clinton's voters believe the FBI had a negative impact on her electoral chances, most still say they trust the FBI ? and just 5 percent believe that the FBI is biased against Trump. And among those who've heard about the memo, just 16 percent think it's even somewhat accurate, with only 4 percent believing it shows wrongdoing on the part of the agency. <br /> The two groups are also getting their news about the memo from distinctly different places. A majority of both Clinton and Trump voters who've followed the story say that cable TV was among the sources they relied on. But while those Clinton voters tuned in largely to [outlet] and [outlet], the Trump voters who watched cable coverage of the story were overwhelmingly likely to say they'd seen it on [outlet]. <br /> Fox covered the memo extensively; Sean Hannity, a Fox host, tweeted that the memo was 'explosive' and revelatory of an 'unprecedented Government abuse of power,' describing the conduct revealed in the memo as 'Watergate times a thousand.' And Republican members of Congress lined up to make explosive claims about the memo's contents ahead of its release. <br /> Now that the memo has been released, just under 70 percent of Americans now say they've heard of it, up from less than 60 percent in a previous survey. (Non-voters have largely tuned out the controversy altogether ? just 18 percent say they've heard a lot about the memo, and those who've heard at least something are relatively split about its accuracy.) <br /> Overall, that leaves 35 percent of Americans who've heard about the memo saying that it shows the FBI did something wrong, and another 34 percent that it vindicates the bureau, with the rest unsure. <br /> Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the former Trump transition team member who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, was the driving force behind the memo. Referring to himself in the third person over the weekend, Trump said the Nunes memo 'totally vindicates 'Trump,''  and on Monday, he called Nunes a 'Great American Hero.' <br /> Republicans who appeared on the Sunday shows cautioned that the memo was a separate issue from the probe that special counsel Robert Mueller is running to examine possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russian interference in the 2016 election, but some Trump voters haven't gotten the message.

But military parades aren't actually unprecedented in the nation's capital. There was one as recently as 1991. That festively branded 'National Victory Celebration' offers something of a blueprint for what we can expect if the Trump triumph actually materializes-and while, though not unprecedented, it's still not a good idea. <br /> It was a beautiful day on June 8, 1991, when President George H. W. Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle, and Cabinet officials peered out through bulletproof glass as legions of camouflaged veterans marched down Constitution Avenue, past the White House, and trekked over Memorial Bridge toward the Pentagon. Some 8,800 enlisted soldiers were deployed for the spectacle, which celebrated the liberation of Kuwait and defeat of Saddam Hussein's military in Operation Desert Storm, concluded several months earlier. Close to 1 million Americans showed up to take in the event. M1A1 Abrams tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles, and Patriot missile launchers rumbled through the streets, and formations of fighter jets also buzzed the city in close formation. The fireworks displayed afterward dwarfed anything Washington had seen before. <br /> Still, hitches were inevitable with such a logistically taxing event. The city government had enough foresight to remove lampposts along the parade route to make way for the convoys of armored vehicles. Less anticipated was the damage wrought as 67-ton tanks rolled over (and through) the hot asphalt on Constitution Avenue. The treaded vehicles pounded a deeply rutted tattoo into the roadway, which had been designed to carry a gross vehicle weight of just over 30 tons, and was further softened that day by the 85-degree heat. <br /> One of the more poetic vignettes took shape as a flock of combat helicopters roared over the Capitol and approached their ceremonial landing zone. Spinning rotor blades kicked up a dust storm along the pathways lining the National Mall. Bits of gravel and dirt sprayed like machine-gun fire, accidentally hosing the adjacent Hirshhorn Sculpture Garden. The most serious casualty of artistic friendly fire was Aristide Maillol's Nymph (Central Figure for 'The Three Graces'). The nude bronze had her back riddled with pockmarks and scratches from the fusillade. <br /> After months of bickering between the Hirshhorn and the Department of Defense about who would pay for a restoration, museum staff thought the prospect of future military parades was far-fetched. 'This is not something that will happen again. It was a freak accident; a helicopter was coming down on the Mall,' Sidney Lawrence, a museum spokesman told the Washington Post later that October. <br /> Washington's last military parade left in its wake 1.2 million pounds of garbage, $12 million in bills, and literal scars on the city's public art and infrastructure. If history is any guide, a march in 2018 will bring its own unanticipated headaches for the District. It also goes without saying that Donald Trump is no George H. W. Bush. A large-scale deployment of government assets under the current administration is sure to be accompanied with a clown car of unforced errors and distasteful performances. Will nuclear weapons be showcased at the event? Will Trump wear epaulets and a sword? <br /> More certain is the negative reaction that such a parade will elicit from the capital city. Bush Sr. enjoyed an approval rating of 73 percent at the time of the National Victory Celebration. Donald Trump currently has an approval rating of 40 percent according to the latest Quinnipiac poll. A Gallup survey from last week puts his approval within the District of Columbia at a near-riotous 6 percent approval and 88 percent disapproval. <br /> Bush's extravaganza also came in the afterglow of a stunning military victory that was televised before national audiences. The 1991 parade was a deliberately presented as a celebration for 'Our country and for all who wear its uniform. . Not just one individual, or one unit, or one command, or even one service.' By contrast, Trump's dream event likely has the contours of a jingoistic MAGA rally. Guest of honor: just one. <br /> The Nymph statue was long ago repaired (at Pentagon expense) and is no longer on display beside the National Mall.

It was Mr. Simpson, a private investigator, who tapped Democratic Party money to hire ex-British spy Christopher Steele, who produced the discredited anti-Trump dossier. <br /> TOP STORIESRush Limbaugh predicts Biden disappearing act before election: 'Something's gonna happen'Coronavirus hype biggest political hoax in historyCoronavirus researcher nearing 'very significant findings' dead in apparent murder-suicide <br /> In August 2017, Mr. Simpson testified in private to committee staff. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, ranking Democrat, later unilaterally released the transcript. <br /> Mr. Simpson was asked directly if he continued to conduct anti-Trump opposition research after the Nov. 8 election. He answered, 'I had no client after the election.' <br /> That answer seems at odds with an FBI interview report, or 302, obtained by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. <br /> The 302 recounted an interview agents' conducted with Daniel Jones, a former senior Feinstein staffer who founded his own investigative firm, Penn Quarter Group. Mr. Jones told the agents he had received $50 million from seven to 10 wealthy donors and that he had hired Fusion GPS and Mr. Steele to continue investigating President Trump. <br /> If Mr. Jones' interview is accurate, it would mean that Fusion did in fact have a post-election client--Penn Quarter Group. <br /> This discrepancy was pointed out by Mr. Grassley in a letter to Sen. Christopher A. Coons, Delaware Democrat. <br /> Mr. Coons wrote to Mr. Grassley asking that Mr. Trump Jr., the president's son, be recalled as a witness. Mr. Coons said his previous testimony seemed to conflict with a May 19 [outlet] article. <br /> As precedent, Mr. Coons cited Mr. Grassley's criminal referral letter to the Justice Department on Mr. Steele. <br /> That referral, Mr. Grassley said in a letter to Mr. Coons on Tuesday, was based on a discrepancy in official sworn documents, not a newspaper story. <br /> According to an October 2016 affidavit filed by the FBI to obtain a surveillance warrant, Mr. Steele told the bureau that he had not spoken to reporters about his dossier. But in fact, Mr. Steele had briefed a number of reporters in Washington the previous month at Mr. Simpson's urging, according to a declaration he filed in a London court where he faces a libel charge. <br /> 'Where we do have actual evidence of misleading testimony in Committee interviews, we should treat it seriously,' Mr. Grassley said in his letter. 'For example, when the Committee staff interviewed Glenn Simpson in August of 2017, Majority staff asked him: 'So you didn't do any work on the Trump matter after the election date, that was the end of your work?' Mr. Simpson answered: 'I had no client after the election.' As we now know, that was extremely misleading, if not an outright lie.' <br /> 'Contrary to Mr. Simpson's denial in the staff interview, according to the FBI and others, Fusion actually did continue Trump dossier work for a new client after the election,' the senator wrote. 'As with the circumstances surrounding the Steele referral, we once again have two seemingly contradictory statements in contexts where material lies are criminal.' <br /> Mr. Simpson was not under oath. But Mr. Grassley's staff explained to him that lying to Congress violates federal law. <br /> Mr. Grassley also took a shot at the [outlet]. <br /> 'To clarify, the Steele referral was based on contradictory information provided in two sworn statements to courts,' Mr. Grassley said 'In contrast, your concern is based on perceived inconsistencies between a Committee interview and a news article. Unfortunately, as we have seen all too frequently, reporting related to the Russia investigation and the Trump campaign has often been inaccurate.' <br /> This is the second hiccup in Mr. Simpson's testimony. <br /> When Mrs. Feinstein released the transcript in January, it showed that Mr. Simpson testified that Mr. Steele was told by the FBI it had a source inside the Trump campaign. <br /> Shortly after the revelation, sources identified in the news media as close to Fusion GPS said Mr. Steele was actually talking about George Papadopoulos and a conversation he had with an Australian diplomat in London. There was no spy. <br /> But later, Joshua A. Levy, Fusion's attorney, attested to Mr. Grassley that, in fact, Mr. Simpson's committee testimony was accurate. <br /> 'I am writing in response to your letter, dated January 11, 2018, in which you have asked about the August 22, 2017 testimony from our client Glenn Simpson that Christopher Steele in the fall of 2016 said he believed the FBI had another source within the Trump organization/campaign. Mr. Simpson stands by his testimony,' Mr. Levy said. <br /> Mr. Levy did not return a message seeking comment. <br /> News reports in recent weeks said the FBI procured the services of academic Stefan Halper to spy on Trump associates.

At one point, Trump mentioned his recently reached trade deal with South Korea, saying, 'I may hold it up until after a deal is made with North Korea. You know why? Because it's a very strong card. And I want to make sure everyone is treated fairly.' <br /> Within a few hours, aides to South Korean President Moon Jae-in were seeking clarification on the statement, working through various channels to understand Trump's 'true intentions.' Good luck on that. <br /> I've sought some clarification myself, to no avail. The remark was either utterly incoherent or a terrible blunder. The former-yet another instance of Trump's incoherence-is the likelier explanation. It's not at all clear why Trump should hold up a trade deal with South Korea, pending the results of nuclear talks with North Korea. The two have little or nothing to do with each other. <br /> But impolitic incompetence should never be dismissed as a source of confusion. Moon will be meeting with Kim-another historic first-on April 27 at Peace House, near the North-South border. It is expected that their meeting will tee up the issues, and to some degree set the agenda, for Kim's meeting with Trump a few weeks later. Trump's relations with Moon are rife with tensions. Trump has harshly criticized Seoul for fair-trade violations (and is said to see the new trade deal as an imperfect solution); he often grumbles that the South Koreans should pay more for their own defense and has threatened to withdraw U.S. forces from the region if they don't-thus arousing fears, in South Korea and Japan, that Trump might do just that in exchange for a promise by North Korea to freeze or cut back its nuclear arsenal. <br /> Trump's remark in Ohio could be read as a threat to Moon: Push Kim hard on his nuclear weapons, maybe even get him to agree to dismantle them in advance of the U.S. summit-do the heavy lifting for us-or forget about the new trade deal. <br /> Viewed in this light, there are three things wrong with Trump's statement. First, as a general rule of bargaining (and the putative author of The Art of the Deal should know this), if you have 'a very strong card' going into a negotiation, you shouldn't announce the fact publicly-otherwise your adversary will minimize its importance or maneuver around it ahead of time. <br /> Second, the new trade deal will correct some imbalances that hurt the United States; Moon agreed to it as a diplomatic concession in advance of the talks with Kim; the deal itself was the result of Trump's leverage. Trump would gain no additional leverage from calling off the deal. If anything, calling it off would help South Korea-unless a cancellation prompted Trump to launch a trade war on Seoul. But if he did that, he would demolish the veneer of allied unity-and thus diminish his bargaining power-at his summit with Kim. <br /> Which leads to the third thing wrong with Trump's remark. Kim's father and grandfather, Kim Jong-il and Kim Il-sung, the previous leaders of North Korea, were masters at playing their stronger foes off one another. Trump is giving the new young leader a wide opening to play the same game. <br /> Which leads to the second statement from last week that casts a gloomy light on the impending summit. It was issued on Tuesday, in the wake of the secret meeting in Beijing between Kim and Chinese President Xi Jinping, and was attributed to Kim by China's official press service: <br /> To longtime Korea-watchers, these are familiar North Korean slogans that don't quite mean what they seem. For instance, to say that 'the issue of the denuclearization of the peninsula' might 'reach resolution' doesn't necessarily mean that North Korea will denuclearize. It could mean simply that 'the issue' will 'reach resolution,' perhaps in some way that allows North Korea to keep some nukes. <br /> But the key phrase here is 'phased, synchronized measures to achieve peace.' Achieving 'peace,' in Pyongyang argot, means ending the Korean War-which settled into an armistice in 1953, but technically is still going on. And the end of the Korean War means the withdrawal of U.S. military forces from South Korea-something that no American president could accept, unless maybe he doesn't understand what 'peace' means in the Korean context. <br /> True, North Koreans have struck deals in the past that fall short of fulfilling this ultimate fantasy. For instance, in the 1994 Agreed Framework with the Clinton administration, they agreed to freeze their plutonium program in exchange for energy assistance and the supply of two light-water reactors, which could be used only for electrical power. An annex to that deal called for further steps toward formal diplomatic relations between Washington and Pyongyang. The deal fell apart after Congress refused to fund the light-water reactors, which prompted North Korea to begin a covert uranium-enrichment program-not a violation of the deal but certainly an end run, which prompted President George W. Bush, who wasn't keen on the deal anyway, to cancel it soon after he took office in 2001. <br /> Does Trump have any idea what sorts of 'phased, synchronized measures' he would like North Korea to take-and what sorts of measures he would permit the United States to take at the same time? For example, as a first step, North Korea could extend its freeze on nuclear testing and open up its production and test sites to international inspection-with the United States simultaneously removing some sanctions. What would be the second, third, and fourth synchronized measures, and what would be the ultimate goal-the finishing line of these steps? These are issues to be discussed by experts, debated in National Security Council meetings, and decided very carefully by the president and his top advisers. If officials at the State Department, the Pentagon, and the NSC aren't already well into this project, they're starting way too late. <br /> It's also worth noting that Trump's incoming national security adviser, John Bolton, has spoken out against the whole concept of phased, synchronized measures, demanding that Kim dismantle his nuclear arsenal, all at once, and urging the United States to launch a first strike if he refuses. Will he offer Trump the same advice, now that he's off [outlet] and inside the White House? Will Trump listen? And who's still around to offer countervailing advice? <br /> Kim Jong-un will come to both negotiations-the one with Moon near the DMZ and the one with Trump at a location not yet determined-with a goal, an agenda, and a bag of bargaining tactics. He may also have sought and won consent for his approach (though there's no way of knowing this) during his meeting in Beijing with Xi. Unless something dramatic happens in the next few weeks, Trump will arrive at the summit with no firm grip on a strategy or tactics-and wavering support from, and for, his allies. He may come instead with the cloak of an unearned self-confidence that he can prevail with a deal through his charisma and instincts. For this kind of deal, that won't be enough."], "ID10" : ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/a-moment-of-awe-photo-of-little-girl-staring-at-michelle-obama-portrait-goes-viral/2018/03/04/4e5a4548-1ff2-11e8-94da-ebf9d112159c_story.html", "'A moment of awe': Photo of little girl captivated by Michelle Obama portrait goes viral", "Parker Curry, age 2, was not being cooperative. <br /> Standing in front of the new painting of former first lady Michelle Obama at the National Portrait Gallery, Parker ignored her mother's pleas to turn around for a photo. <br /> 'All I wanted was just one pic,' Parker's mother, Jessica Curry, said Sunday. 'She was just so fixated on the portrait and wouldn't turn away from it.' <br /> Curry, a lifelong District resident, was so fixated on her daughter being fixated on the portrait that she didn't see a man to the side taking a cellphone photo of the moment - Parker in utter awe, her mouth agape. <br /> The next morning, Curry said, her phone 'blew up.' <br /> The man to the side - -37-year-old Ben Hines, who was in town from North Carolina visiting his parents in Alexandria - posted the photo on Facebook. It went really, really viral. And suddenly, little Parker went from being a little difficult to being more than a little famous. <br /> The photo, taken Thursday, has been shared, liked, tweeted, retweeted and Instagrammed thousands of times around the world. Obama reacted with not one but three heart-eye emoji. <br /> Many of those who responded to the photo said they were -inspired by Parker's reaction. <br /> 'This is what America is all about,' tweeted an Atlanta man. 'This young girl can now dream about being someone like Michelle Obama.' <br /> Tweeted another: 'I needed to cry over something beautiful -instead of crying over frustrating news.' <br /> The striking portrait of Obama - in a long, flowing dress against a light blue background - was painted by Baltimore artist Amy Sherald, who was chosen by the former first lady. <br /> 'The first lady inhabits a world of calm, clarity and Wedgwood-hued enlightenment,' Washington Post art critic Philip Kennicott wrote. <br /> At her portrait's unveiling Obama said she was thinking of little girls - and girls of color, 'who in the years ahead will come to this place and see an image of someone who looks like them hanging on the wall of a great American institution. .?.?. And I know the kind of impact that will have on their lives because I was one of those girls.' <br /> The Obamas' portraits are not what you'd expect, and that's why they're great <br /> Parker's mother said she was amazed at the attention the photo has received. <br /> 'It's been unbelievable,' Curry said Sunday. <br /> Parker, in her less than 36 months alive, has become a big admirer of the former first lady. She especially enjoyed seeing Obama dance on 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show.' After seeing the portrait, Parker thinks Obama is a 'queen.' <br /> (Curry is not certain her daughter knows that Michelle's husband is former president Barack Obama or that he even -exists.) <br /> That a little girl could be in such awe of the former first lady was precisely what Hines wanted to capture in taking the photo. <br /> 'It was a moment of awe and inspiration,' Hines said. 'I was just lucky to be there for it.' <br /> Hines, visiting the gallery with his mother, tried to find Curry later, but lost her in the crowds. He shared the photo on Facebook hoping the Internet might turn up Parker's mother. Hines wanted to send her the photo himself and tell her how moved he was. <br /> The image traveled fast. <br /> Hines's friends and family admired and shared the photo not realizing he took it. Meanwhile, Curry couldn't figure out what was happening. She barely uses social media. <br /> She asked her sister, who was with her that day, if she had taken the photo and posted it. Nope. Eventually, with help from more digitally savvy friends, Curry figured out a guy named Ben Hines took the photo. Then someone who knew her tagged her on Hines's Facebook post. <br /> They spoke on the phone. <br /> 'It was a wonderful conversation,' Hines said. 'It's just a wonderful and very hopeful thing that happened.' <br /> So, how is Parker dealing with the sudden fame? <br /> For starters, she's staying -humble. <br /> She didn't throw a fit when her grandmother called her 'a star,' but she made clear that talk wasn't for her. <br /> 'I'm not a star,' she said.

But boy, it would make it easy.", "Amol Mehra is executive director of the International Corporate Accountability Roundtable. <br /> I didn't pursue a law degree to learn how to launder money for human traffickers, opioid kingpins or corrupt public officials. But my legal training has helped me to understand just how easy it would be. <br /> Anonymous companies are ubiquitous in most money-laundering schemes, <br />and in the  allegations against Trump campaign associates Paul Manafort and Richard Gates. Shell companies are formed with no record of the true owners, and because they are so easy to set up - especially if you're a lawyer - you can easily layer dozens of them to confuse investigators and hide dirty money. <br /> A Delaware-based LLC could own a Nevada-based C corporation, which could be owned by a Panamanian company, and on and on. That makes it nearly impossible for investigators to untangle these webs. In 2012, Cyrus Vance Jr., district attorney of New York County, said this about anonymous companies: 'My office, time and time again, finds its criminal investigations thwarted by an absurd system of secrecy whereby criminals can hide their money.' <br /> In 2016, anti-slavery advocates at the Polaris Project analyzed public information to identify human trafficking occurring in businesses fronting as massage parlors across the country. The inability to identify who owned or controlled the companies was a recurring challenge in every location. In Fairfax County alone, Polaris identified 108 illicit massage businesses that were connected to 181 corporations. <br /> I can't help but think about the legal services that may have helped form those 181 corporations. <br /> Because anonymous shell companies are a factor in so many <br />kinds of cases - hiding proceeds from the ongoing opioid crisis, <br />funding terrorism, enabling corruption in the oil and gas industries<br /> - there is large and growing bipartisan support for a bill to collect ownership information on anonymous companies. Remarkably, it might pass. <br /> These reforms are backed by a broad coalition, made up of supporters including law enforcement agencies, progressive anti-poverty groups and large financial institutions. They advocate policies that would require companies to disclose their owners to the government. In turn, the government would share that information with law enforcement and institutions with anti-money-laundering requirements. <br /> Yet bizarrely, and regrettably, the American Bar Association opposes these reforms. Even more bizarre are the ABA's arguments. <br /> It says that the way these reforms would define the 'beneficial owner' behind a company would be 'unworkable' - too complicated for small businesses and their lawyers. This is despite the fact that small-business groups support anonymous company reforms and the definition of ownership used<br /> in most of the bills. <br /> The ABA also says that people could face jail time for making 'paperwork violations,' even though the bill uses the same intentionality standard present in the ABA's own guidelines on this issue to ensure that all parties would be absolved in the case of an honest mistake. <br /> Instead of supporting needed reforms, the ABA promotes a set of voluntary guidelines it developed in 2010, even though it's painfully clear that those guidelines aren't working. This point was made in an excruciating manner by a Global Witness undercover investigation that aired on '60 Minutes' in 2016. In that expose, an investigator posed as a representative of a foreign governmental official and asked for legal services to move money into the United States, using terms that should have made it obvious that he was seeking help to launder suspect funds. <br /> Twelve of the 13 law firms approached offered advice on how to bring the possibly illicit money into the United States, recommendations that typically involved setting up a string of anonymous shell companies. One went as far as to say he wasn't worried about jail because 'lawyers run the country - we make the laws.' One of the lawyers offering advice was James Silkenat, president of the American Bar Association at the time, though he indicated that he would have had to check further before taking on the work and report any criminal activity he might have discovered. <br /> That attitude does not reflect well on our profession. If we want to reflect the better angels of our nature, we need to speak up, be accountable for our actions and do the right thing.

Among conservatives, there is the broad belief that the right to own a weapon for self-defense is every bit as inherent and unalienable as the right to speak freely or practice your religion. It's a co-equal liberty in the Bill of Rights, grounded not just in the minds of the Founders but in natural law. <br /> Against this backdrop, most forms of gun control proposed after each mass killing represent a collective punishment. The rights of the law-abiding are restricted with no real evidence that these alleged 'common sense' reforms will prevent future tragedies in any meaningful way. <br /> Many progressives, however, simply don't care about restrictions on gun ownership. They don't view it as an individual right, much less an unalienable one. To them, the Second Amendment is an embarrassment, an American quirk that should be limited and confined as much as possible. To them, gun ownership is a privilege, not a right, and can be heavily regulated and restricted without doing any violence at all to individual liberty. <br /> To describe these differences is not to say that the two sides never meet. Putting aside the relatively meaningless polls about various gun-control measures - the polls that truly matter are at the ballot box, and there the results are very clear and very distinct for both red and blue - there is broad conceptual agreement that regardless of whether you view gun ownership as a right or a privilege, a person can demonstrate through their conduct that they have no business possessing a weapon. <br /> Felons, the dangerously mentally ill, perpetrators of domestic violence - these people have not only demonstrated their unfitness to own a weapon, they've been granted due process to contest the charges or claims against them. There is no arbitrary state action. There is no collective punishment. There is, rather, an individual, constitutional state process, and the result of that process is a set of defined consequences that includes revoking the right to gun ownership. <br /> Now, let's back up for a moment and apply this reasoning to our contagion of mass shootings. Time and again mass shooters give off warning signals. They issue generalized threats. They post disturbing images. They exhibit fascination with mass killings. But before the deadly act itself, there is no clear path to denying them access to guns. Though people can report their concerns to authorities, sometimes those authorities fail or have limited tools to deal with the emerging danger. <br /> What if, however, there was an evidence-based process for temporarily denying a troubled person access to guns? What if this process empowered family members and others close to a potential shooter, allowing them to 'do something' after they 'see something' and 'say something'? I've written that the best line of defense against mass shootings is an empowered, vigilant citizenry. There is a method that has the potential to empower citizens even more, when it's carefully and properly implemented. <br /> It's called a gun-violence restraining order, or GVRO. <br /> While there are various versions of these laws working their way through the states (California passed a GVRO statute in 2014, and it went into effect in 2016), broadly speaking they permit a spouse, parent, sibling, or person living with a troubled individual to petition a court for an order enabling law enforcement to temporarily take that individual's guns right away. A well-crafted GVRO should contain the following elements ('petitioners' are those who seek the order, 'the respondent' is its subject): <br /> The concept of the GVRO is simple, not substantially different from the restraining orders that are common in family law, and far easier to explain to the public than our nation's mental-health adjudications. Moreover, the requirement that the order come from people close to the respondent and that they come forward with real evidence (e.g. sworn statements, screenshots of social-media posts, copies of journal entries) minimizes the chance of bad-faith claims. <br /> The great benefit of the GVRO is that it provides citizens with options other than relying on, say, the FBI. As the bureau admitted today, it did not respond appropriately to a timely warning from a 'person close to Nikolas Cruz.' According the FBI, that person provided 'information about Cruz's gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting.' <br /> In other words, it appears the FBI received exactly the kind of information that would justify granting a GVRO. <br /> Just since 2015, the Charleston church shooter, the Orlando nightclub shooter, the Sutherland Springs church shooter, and the Parkland school shooter each happened after federal authorities missed chances to stop them. For those keeping score, that's four horrific mass shootings in four years where federal systems failed, at a cost of more than 100 lives. <br /> In other words, proper application of existing policies and procedures could have saved lives, but the people in the federal government failed. And they keep failing. So let's empower different people. Let's empower the people who have the most to lose, and let's place accountability on the lowest possible level of government: the local judges who consistently and regularly adjudicate similar claims in the context of family and criminal law. <br /> The GVRO is consistent with and recognizes both the inherent right of self-defense and the inherent right of due process. It is not collective punishment. It is precisely targeted. <br /> Advocates for GVROs have been mostly clustered on the left, but there is nothing inherently leftist about the concept. After all, the GVRO is consistent with and recognizes both the inherent right of self-defense and the inherent right of due process. It is not collective punishment. It is precisely targeted. <br /> As I wrote the night of the Parkland shooting, a vigilant citizenry is a far better defense against a mass shooting than the sweeping, allegedly 'common sense' gun-control measures debated after every massacre. But when individual citizens are vigilant and individual government officials are not, then it's time to consider different measures. It's time to consider rearranging the balance of power. <br /> I don't pretend that a GVRO is the solution to mass killings. There is no 'solution.' It's a tool, one among many. In 2016 California courts granted 86 restraining orders. Most of them applied for a mere 21 days. In ten instances those orders were extended for a year. Until I'm persuaded otherwise (and I look forward to the conversation), I'll believe that a restraining order can give a family the power federal incompetence has taken away - the power to save lives."], "ID14" : ["usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/03/02/florida-shooting-red-flags-blood-stained-classrooms-editorials-debates/381036002", "In Florida shooting, red flags and blood-stained classrooms", "As in the months before the 9/11 attacks - when 'the system was blinking red' but various arms of the federal government failed to connect the dots - Broward County Sheriff's Office, the FBI and a Florida social service agency had troubling tips or encounters involving school shooter Nikolas Cruz. <br /> That information didn't simply fall through cracks. It was crying out for follow-up. Different people made decisions not to do anything about it. <br /> No one can say for certain that following those leads would have prevented  the tragedy in which 17 people died. But that doesn't absolve officials for failing to look into those tips with greater diligence. <br /> SHERIFF: 'I have given amazing leadership' <br /> On Monday, the Florida Senate plans to vote on a series of measures, including creating a commission to investigate any 'system failures' by local, state and federal authorities before the shooting. The state Senate already rejected a ban and a moratorium on sale of AR-15s. Still alive are other gun control measures, including raising the age to buy assault weapons. Those sensible changes are long overdue, as is calling authorities to account for missing so many critical warnings. <br /> The sheriff's office had received calls going back nearly 10 years about Cruz, 19. Sheriff Scott Israel says there were 23 calls; [outlet] obtained records showing a total of 45. Regardless of the number, the reports grew more unnerving over the years,from a report of Cruz fighting with his younger brother to one about throwing his mother against a wall. <br /> The most alarming calls piled up during the past two years. <br /> In 2016, a neighbor warned the sheriff's office of an Instagram post in which Cruz said he 'planned to shoot up the school.' Months later came a report that Cruz might have tried to commit suicide. A law enforcement officer, assigned to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High as a 'resource deputy,' initiated a report. The school said it would do a 'threat assessment,' and a private therapist on the scene said Cruz was not a danger to himself or others. <br /> The Florida Department of Children and Families came to a similar conclusion. Had Cruz been pegged as a danger, that might have triggered a court-ordered commitment to a mental health facility. It never got that far. <br /> Last November, after Cruz's mother died, a cousin urged the sheriff's office to collect Cruz's guns. A deputy responded, and a family friend agreed to take them, according to a record of the encounter. Later that month, a caller said he believed Cruz 'could be a school shooter in the making.' Despite Cruz's history and the recurring school shooting threats, a deputy advised that person to call the sheriff in Palm Beach County, where Cruz then lived. Laziness or ineptitude are the only conceivable explanations for the deputy failing to make that call personally. <br /> The FBI dropped the ball, too. Last fall, it got a tip that someone identified as 'nikolas cruz' posted on YouTube that he was 'going to be a professional school shooter.' On Jan. 5, a person close to Cruz called the FBI's Public Access Line citing concerns about 'Cruz's gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting.' <br /> Coupled with the earlier tip, that should have gone to the FBI's Miami field office. But 'protocols were not followed,' the FBI acknowledged. <br /> That's more than Sheriff Israel has acknowledged. Despite the missed warnings and the sheriff's deputy who stayed outside the school during the murderous rampage, Israel still patted himself on the back for his 'amazing leadership' in a [outlet] interview. 'I can only take responsibility for what I knew about.' <br /> Clearly, Israel never heard of Harry Truman and 'the buck stops here.' It's hard to believe he can take the actions necessary to ensure that the same grievous errors are not repeated. <br /> As for the future, authorities across the country need more tools to help them when they receive warnings about behavior that's disturbing but falls short of what's needed for an arrest or a seizure of weapons. <br /> Several states - California, Connecticut, Indiana, Oregon and Washington - allow either law enforcement or immediate family members to seek a court restraining order to seize a disturbed person's guns. The National Rifle Association and other gun rights groups have battled this sensible idea. <br /> Florida is considering a more limited measure, but at least it would be a start. <br /> Red flags, of course, always flap more vigorously in the breeze of hindsight. Some spree killers, such as the Las Vegas hotel gunman, give off few if any warning signs and can be fiendishly difficult to identify. <br /> Other mass killers, however, are loudly ticking time bombs. In Cruz's case, the sounds were explicit and numerous.

Ted Lieu of California and Don Beyer of Virginia wrote Tuesday to EPA's inspector general, asking him to look into a lease Pruitt signed to rent a room on Capitol Hill for $50 a night. The lease, which Pruitt signed with health care lobbyist Vicki Hart - the wife of energy lobbyist J. Steven Hart - allowed him to only pay for the nights he stayed in the two-bedroom condo. <br /> 'The unusual, short-term sweetheart deal that Administrator Pruitt received from Mr. and Mrs. Hart was not just far below market rate, the terms were so skewed in Pruitt's favor that such a lease doesn't even exist on the market for an ordinary citizen,' the lawmakers wrote. <br /> Over the course of six months, Pruitt reportedly paid $6,100 for the total time he spent at the condo. <br /> 'This is far below market value and, as such, would constitute an impermissible gift under federal regulations,' the lawmakers wrote. They said a cursory search found that comparable rents in the area would be between $2,600 and $5,000 a month. <br /> They also concluded said that it could violate federal law if the lease was given to Pruitt to curry favor. <br /> Additionally, the lawmakers asked for EPA's inspector general to review a retroactive ethics opinion that deemed the rent deal was acceptable. <br /> The opinion, written by EPA ethics official Kevin Minoli, was written and released Friday, amid ongoing reports about the rent deal. In the opinion, Minoli concluded that Pruitt was paying a 'reasonable market value.' <br /> 'That is false,' the lawmakers wrote. 'To determine what would be fair market value, one needs to look at 'comparable leases.'' <br /> Further, EPA has said the lease also allowed Pruitt's daughter, who interned at the White House last summer, to stay in the other bedroom of the condo. Lieu and Beyer pointed to a news report in which Vicki Hart said that wasn't a part of their agreement. <br /> 'This discrepancy is further evidence of the need for the EPA Inspector General to conduct an investigation to determine if misconduct or mismanagement led to said OGC decision, and whether the Ethics Office was influenced in any improper manner,' they wrote. <br /> EPA did not immediately return a request for comment on Tuesday's letter. <br /> "], "ID16" : ["https://www.foxnews.com/us/off-duty-arkansas-police-officer-killed-inside-his-home", "Off-duty Arkansas police officer killed inside his home", "An Arkansas police officer was shot and killed inside his own home Saturday, officials said. <br /> Forrest City Police Officer Oliver Johnson, Jr. was inside his home just before 2 p.m. in West Memphis, Ark., when an unidentified person unleashed a spray of bullets at his home, FOX13 Memphis reported.

But the president grew tired of his prepared remarks after a few moments and returned to the bitter complaints about the United States' immigration laws that have dominated his attention this week and prompted him on Wednesday to ask governors to deploy the National Guard to the southern border. <br /> 'This was going to be my remarks - it would have taken about two minutes, but what the hell - that would have been a little boring,' Mr. Trump said, tossing a sheet of paper covered with neat paragraphs of text into the audience. 'I'm reading off the first paragraph, I said, 'This is boring.' Come on. We have to tell it like it is.' <br /> Instead, he recounted the terrorist attack last October in Lower Manhattan, in which an Uzbek immigrant killed eight people when he drove a truck onto a pedestrian and bicycle path on the West Side Highway. <br /> 'This is what the Democrats are doing to you, and they like it because they think they're going to vote Democrat,' Mr. Trump said. 'They're doing it for that reason, and other reasons.' <br /> The president later told reporters aboard Air Force One that he intended to deploy 2,000 to 4,000 National Guard troops to the border with Mexico. If Mr. Trump sends the low end of his proposal, it would barely exceed the 1,200 sent by President Barack Obama in 2010 to support other border agencies. Even if Mr. Trump sends 4,000, the top end of his proposal, he would be dispatching fewer than President George W. Bush did in 2006. <br /> In a statement on Thursday, the Pentagon press secretary, Dana White, said that the National Guard troops would focus on engineering, logistical support and vehicle maintenance among other things. The statement did not mention the troops taking part in law enforcement. <br /> Republican leaders have urged the president to sell the tax cut that he signed in December, and have tried to make economic growth and low taxes the central theme of 2018 as they move toward a difficult midterm election season. But Mr. Trump has refused to keep to the script. <br /> Instead on Thursday, he opted to blast immigrants and the country's immigration laws, including a practice known as 'catch and release,' in which migrants who present themselves at the border are released from custody to await an immigration hearing to determine whether they should be allowed to remain in the United States. <br /> 'We're toughening up at the border,' Mr. Trump said. 'We cannot let people enter our country - we have no idea who they are, what they do, where they came from.' <br /> 'We don't know if they're murderers, if they're killers, if they're MS-13,' Mr. Trump went on. 'We're throwing them out by the hundreds.' <br /> He boasted that he had described immigrants as rapists when he announced his presidential candidacy, saying that he had recently learned that during the journey north made by a caravan of Honduran migrants, 'women are raped at levels they've never seen before.' <br /> Mr. Trump also said his administration had cracked down on MS-13, the transnational gang with links to El Salvador, detailing its brutal methods. <br /> 'This is the kind of stuff and crap that we're allowing into our country, and we can't do it,' Mr. Trump said. <br /> He also repeated his false claim that millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election. <br /> 'They always like to say, 'Oh, that's a conspiracy theory,'' Mr. Trump said. 'Not a conspiracy theory, folks. Millions and millions of people.' <br /> Mr. Trump's remarks drew enthusiastic applause from an audience of about 200 in a state that he won with 68 percent of the vote, his largest margin of victory in the country. <br /> But it also drew rebukes. <br /> 'President Trump is insulting American voters by making up lies,' said Jason Kander, a former Democratic candidate for the Senate and now the president of Let America Vote, a voting rights group. 'President Trump's lies cause the American electorate to lose faith in our system of elections and take our elections less seriously, which is one of his goals. If people don't trust that their vote counts, then they won't vote.' <br /> The round table on taxes was a lovefest for the president, in which attendees took turns praising him and recounting the ways in which the tax measure and Mr. Trump's agenda had helped them and their families. <br /> 'This is a big deal for our family,' Jessica Hodge said, choking back tears after her husband told Mr. Trump that their family had saved $2,417 because of the tax cut. He said they planned to spend it on a kitchen renovation. <br /> 'Thank you for listening to us. Thank you for fighting for us,' she added. <br /> The president grinned and nodded his approval. <br /> Evan Jenkins, a West Virginia House member, and Patrick Morrisey, the state's attorney general - who are competing in a May primary to run for the Senate - flanked Mr. Trump and took turns showering him with praise. <br /> 'You're a man keeping your promises,' Mr. Jenkins said. 'Thanks for keeping your promise.' <br /> Mr. Morrisey chimed in. 'Your policies really have made an incredible difference in our state,' he said, adding, 'We had the bull's-eye on us until you got here, so thank you for that.' <br /> As he wrapped up the event, Mr. Trump asked the audience to weigh in on which man should win the primary next month. <br /> 'Should we do a little test?' he said. 'Who's voting for Patrick? Who's voting for Evan?' <br /> The applause was loudest for Mr. Jenkins, who represents the district that White Sulphur Springs is in. <br /> Mr. Trump also attacked Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, saying that he had opposed tough immigration laws and the rest of the president's agenda. <br /> 'I thought he would be helpful because he talks,' Mr. Trump said of Mr. Manchin, a centrist who is known for seeking compromises with Republicans. 'But he votes against everything, and he voted against our tax cuts.' <br /> While Mr. Trump spent little time promoting the tax measure he had come to celebrate, he seemed to feed off the adulation of his crowd and relish his detour off-script. Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One as he returned to Washington, the president asked how the event had gone. <br /> Greeted with silence, Mr. Trump answered his own question, saying he was 'very happy.' <br /> 'Thought it was really great,' he added."], "ID18" : ["https://dailycaller.com/2018/02/15/florida-sheriff-ultimatum-to-media/?utm_content=buffer1b7e3&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer", "Florida Sheriff Just Delivered Ultimatum To Media: Leave Families Of Murdered Children ALONE", "Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel addressed reporters Thursday after the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida. <br /> A gunman opened fire at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida Wednesday afternoon, killing 17.

Read the latest, here. <br /> WASHINGTON - The 2020 census will ask respondents whether they are United States citizens, the Commerce Department announced Monday night, agreeing to a Trump administration request with highly charged political and social implications that many officials feared would result in a substantial undercount. <br /> In a statement released Monday, the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had 'determined that reinstatement of a citizenship question on the 2020 decennial census questionnaire is necessary to provide complete and accurate census block level data,' allowing the department to accurately measure the portion of the population eligible to vote. <br /> But his decision immediately invited a legal challenge: Xavier Becerra, California's attorney general, plans to sue the Trump administration over the decision, a spokeswoman for Mr. Becerra said late Monday. <br /> Critics of the change and experts in the Census Bureau itself have said that, amid a fiery immigration debate, the inclusion of a citizenship question could prompt immigrants who are in the country illegally not to respond. That would result in a severe undercount of the population - and, in turn, faulty data for government agencies and outside groups that rely on the census. The effects would also bleed into the redistricting of the House and state legislatures in the next decade. <br /> The Justice Department had requested the change in December, arguing that asking participants about their citizenship status in the decennial census would help enforce Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which aims to prevent voting rights violations. <br /> 'The Justice Department is committed to free and fair elections for all Americans, and has sought reinstatement of the citizenship question on the census to fulfill that commitment,' a Justice Department spokesman, Devin M. O'Malley, told The [outlet] in February. <br /> In a memorandum explaining his decision, Mr. Ross wrote that he had considered opponents' arguments about the potential to discourage responses. <br /> 'I find that the need for accurate citizenship data and the limited burden that the reinstatement of the citizenship question would impose outweigh fears about a potentially lower response rate,' he wrote. <br /> The decennial census generally included a citizenship inquiry for more than 100 years through 1950, according to the Commerce Department. And other, smaller population surveys, such as the Current Population Survey and the American Community Survey, continue to ask respondents about it. <br /> But critics dismissed administration officials' reassurances. <br /> 'The census numbers provide the backbone for planning how our communities can grow and thrive in the coming decade,' said Mr. Becerra. 'What the Trump administration is requesting is not just alarming, it is an unconstitutional attempt to discourage an accurate census count.' <br /> Others argued that an undercount in regions with high immigrant populations would lead not only to unreliable data but also to unfair redistricting, to the benefit of Republicans. <br /> 'Adding this question will result in a bad census - deeply flawed population data that will skew public and private sector decisions to ensure equal representation, allocate government resources and anticipate economic growth opportunities - for the next 10 years,' Vanita Gupta, the chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and a deputy attorney general in the Obama administration, said in a statement Monday night. 'The stakes are too high to allow this. We urge Congress to overturn this error in judgment.' <br /> The announcement of the citizenship question comes at a troublesome time for the Census Bureau: Its top two positions have interim occupants, and it has been forced to skip two of its three trial runs for the 2020 census because of funding shortfalls. If response rates for the census are low, critics worry that the bureau may be unable to adjust the data or deploy enough census takers to low-response communities. <br /> The bureau is required to submit a final list of the 2020 census questions to Congress by the end of March."]} \n {"ID1" : ["https://dailycaller.com/2018/04/15/franklin-graham-trumps-prayer/", "Franklin Graham Responds To President Trump's Call For Prayer Amid Syria Strikes", "Reverend Franklin Graham joined 'Fox & Friends' on Sunday morning to discuss the fact that, even as American missiles were being fired on Syrian targets, President Donald Trump was calling for prayer. <br /> Like his father, the late Reverend Billy Graham, he has a long history of praying with and for political leaders.

'We're not taking the lead. We're matching.' <br /> The next day, when the expulsions were announced publicly, Trump erupted, officials said. To his shock and dismay, France and Germany were each expelling only four Russian officials - far fewer than the 60 his administration had decided on. <br /> The president, who seemed to believe that other individual countries would largely equal the United States, was furious that his administration was being portrayed in the media as taking by far the toughest stance on Russia. <br /> His briefers tried to reassure him that the sum total of European expulsions was roughly the same as the U.S. number. <br /> 'I don't care about the total!' the administration official recalled Trump screaming. The official, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. <br /> Growing angrier, Trump insisted that his aides had misled him about the magnitude of the expulsions. 'There were curse words,' the official said, 'a lot of curse words.' <br /> The incident reflects a tension at the core of the Trump administration's increasingly hard-nosed stance on Russia: The president instinctually opposes many of the punitive measures pushed by his Cabinet that have crippled his ability to forge a close relationship with Russian President Vladi-mir Putin. <br /> Doubting the intelligence, Trump pursues Putin and leaves a Russian threat unchecked <br /> The past month, in particular, has marked a major turning point in the administration's stance, according to senior administration officials. There have been mass expulsions of Russian diplomats, sanctions on oligarchs that have bled billions of dollars from Russia's already weak economy and, for the first time, a presidential tweet that criticized Putin by name for backing Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. <br /> On Friday night, the United States, acting with Britain and France, attacked Assad's chemical weapons facilities as punishment for what they say was his use of agents on civilians. U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said Sunday that the administration plans to announce additional sanctions against Russia soon. <br /> A White House spokesman stressed that Trump's Russia policy has been 'consistent and tough' from his earliest days in office, and that the president supports the recent moves. <br /> 'While we would like to work with Russia, when faced with their malign activities on the international stage, the president will hold them accountable,' Raj Shah said. <br /> Some close to Trump say the recent measures are the product of an ongoing pressure campaign to push the president to take a more skeptical view of the Russian leader. <br /> 'If you're getting briefed by the CIA director on all this stuff, there's a point where, even if you're Donald J. Trump, you think, 'Hmm [Putin's] a really bad guy,'?' said former House speaker Newt Gingrich, an informal Trump adviser. <br /> Others note Trump's ongoing unease with his own policy. Even as his administration has ratcheted up the pressure on Putin's inner circle, Trump has continued in recent weeks to make overtures to the Russian leader, congratulating him on his election win and, in a move that frustrated his national security team, inviting him to visit the White House. <br /> 'I think I could have a very good relationship with Russia and with President Putin,' Trump said at a news conference just days after the largest expulsion of Russians in U.S. history. 'And if I did, that would be a great thing. And there's also a possibility that won't happen. Who knows?' <br /> Trump came to the White House believing that his personal relationships with other leaders would be central to solving the world's thorniest foreign policy problems, administration officials said. In Trump's mind, no leader was more important or powerful than Putin, they said. <br /> A cooperative relationship with the Russian leader could help Trump find solutions to problems that bedeviled his predecessor in places such as Ukraine, Syria and North Korea. <br /> Former president Barack Obama had a tense relationship with Putin. Trump said he could do better but felt stymied by the media, Congress and special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's probe into Russia's interference in the 2016 election. <br /> Any conciliatory move he made toward Putin came under heavy scrutiny. 'When will all the haters and fools out there realize that having a good relationship is a good thing,' Trump tweeted in November. 'They are always playing politics - bad for our country.' <br /> Privately, he complained to aides that the media's fixation on the Mueller probe was hobbling his effort to woo Putin. 'I can't put on the charm,' the president often said, according to one of his advisers. 'I'm not able to be president because of this witch hunt.' <br /> As the months passed, the president's options for improving relations with Russia narrowed. In late July, Congress overwhelmingly approved new sanctions on Moscow that were widely seen as a rebuke of Trump's efforts to reach out to Putin. It took aides four days to persuade Trump to sign the bill, which had cleared with a veto-proof majority. <br /> Trump advisers were reluctant to even raise the topic of Russian interference in the election, which Trump equated with Democrats' efforts to undermine his victory. 'It's just kind of its own beast,' a senior national security official said. 'It's been a constant from Day One.' <br /> Gingrich and other Trump advisers said CIA Director Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state nominee, was one of the few advisers who could address Russia without raising the president's ire. <br /> In January, Pompeo told the BBC that he had 'every expectation' that Russia would make an effort to disrupt the 2018 midterm elections. Privately, he pushed Trump to take a tough line on Moscow. <br /> One area where aides worked to change Trump's mind was on a proposal to sell antitank missiles to Ukraine. Obama had opposed the move for fear of angering Moscow and provoking a Russian escalation. <br /> Trump initially was also hesitant to support the move, which had the backing of the Pentagon and State Department. 'He would say, 'Why is this our problem? Why not let the Europeans deal with Ukraine?' a U.S. official said. <br /> Aides described a lobbying effort by Pompeo, Haley and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in support of the lethal aid. 'I just want peace,' Trump would say when pressed on Ukraine. <br /> His aides countered that the weapons would help achieve peace by deterring further Russian aggression. <br /> To bring the president around, U.S. officials argued that the $47 million military aid package could be a boon to U.S. taxpayers if cash-strapped Kiev stabilized and someday became a reliable buyer of American military hardware. <br /> To the surprise of even his closest advisers, the president agreed late last year to the weapons transfer on the condition that the move be kept quiet and made without a formal news release. <br /> Aides tried to warn him that there was almost no way to stop the news from leaking. <br /> When it broke, Russia hawks in Congress praised the president. 'Another significant step in the right direction,' said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a frequent Trump critic. But Trump was still furious, an administration official said. <br /> 'For some reason, when it comes to Russia, he doesn't hear the praise,' a senior administration official said. 'Politically speaking, the best thing for him to do is to be tough. .?.?. On that one issue, he cannot hear the praise.' <br /> The poisoning in Britain in early March of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, with a nerve agent upped the tension between Trump and his advisers. <br /> Initially, the president was hesitant to believe the intelligence that Russia was behind the attack - a fact that some aides attributed to his contrarian personality and tendency to look for deeper conspiracies. To persuade him, his advisers warned that he would get hammered in the press if he was out of step with U.S. allies, officials said. <br /> 'There was a sense that we couldn't be the only ones not to concede to reality,' the Trump adviser said. <br /> The next task was convincing Trump that he should punish Putin in coordination with the Europeans. 'Why are you asking me to do this?' Trump asked in a call with British Prime Minister Theresa May, according to a senior White House official. 'What's Germany going to do? What about France?' <br /> He was insistent that the poisoning in the English city of Salisbury was largely a European problem and that the allies should take the lead in moving against Russia. <br /> Trump told aides in an Oval Office session on March 23 that he was confident French President Emmanuel Macron would deliver on promises to expel Russian officials but that he was worried about German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose country depends on Russian oil and gas. <br /> The next day, at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump's aides gave him the final memo with the precise number of American expulsions. <br /> The president signed the order on the plane back to Washington. <br /> Trump was furious as news reports described the expulsions as the largest purge in U.S. history and noted the wide gap between the United States and its allies. 'If you had told me France and Germany were only doing [four], that's what we would have done,' one official recalled him saying. <br /> Some officials said it was a simple misunderstanding. Others blamed the president's strained relationship with his top aides, including H.R. McMaster, his former national security adviser. <br /> 'Anytime McMaster came in with a recommendation, he always thought it was too much,' the Trump adviser said. 'They were just oil and water on everything. So his natural impulse was, if this was your recommendation, it must be too far.' <br /> In the days since the expulsions, Trump has continued to take tough new actions to punish Russia. Early this month, the administration sanctioned 17 senior Russian officials and seven oligarchs and their companies, prompting Russia's Foreign Ministry to threaten a 'harsh response.' <br /> The sanctions were followed by an alleged chemical attack that killed dozens of Syrians in the rebel-held town of Douma, east of Syria's capital. 'President Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad,' Trump tweeted in his first by-name criticism of the Russian leader. 'Big price to pay.' <br /> The relatively modest airstrikes that Trump ordered Friday were designed to deter Assad without provoking a broader military conflict with Russia. <br /> Some European diplomats in Washington question whether the tough moves have Trump's full support. 'This wouldn't be the policy unless Trump supports it. .?.?. Yes?' asked one ambassador. <br /> Russia analysts seem just as mystified. 'This is a man who if he had his druthers would be pursuing a much more open and friendly policy with Russia,' said Angela Stent, a former White House official and professor at Georgetown University. 'The United States essentially has three Russia policies: the president's, the executive branch's and Congress's.' <br /> Less than a month after Trump shocked his foreign policy advisers by inviting Putin to the White House, the prospects for a visit anytime soon seem remote. No date has been set, White House officials said. <br /> 'We're not rushing to do this meeting,' a senior administration official said.

'But the reality on the ground is deploying these tariffs will destroy American jobs and negatively impact anyone who wants to participate in and benefit from clean energy.' <br /> Solar companies created 1 in 50 new jobs in the U.S. in 2016, with the help of imported solar panels that drastically reduced prices. (The Solar Foundation projects that number will be even higher for 2017; its report on last year's figures is due out in a few weeks.) Most of those jobs are at companies that install solar panels on rooftops and build large solar farms for utilities and big corporations. <br /> At the same time, domestic solar panel manufacturers have suffered, unable to compete with cheaper rivals from abroad. Last year, Suniva, a Georgia-based manufacturer owned by a Chinese company, filed a trade complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) after declaring bankruptcy, arguing that it's impossible to compete with cheap imports. In May, SolarWorld, the Oregon-based subsidiary of a German panel maker, joined the complaint. The companies requested that the White House impose fees on imported panels under the 1974 Trade Act that would more than double the price of solar cells from about 33 cents to roughly 78 cents per watt. <br /> Instead, Trump approved a 30 percent fee on all imported solar panels, decreasing by 5 percent per year over four years. The decision is in line with what the ITC recommended in October, a proposal Suniva called 'disappointing.' <br /> About half of all solar equipment used in the U.S. this year is projected to come from overseas. <br /> The fees are forecast to reduce solar installations by 10 percent over five years, according to new calculations by GTM Research, a renewable energy market data firm. The Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group, said the tariffs would lead to 23,000 job losses this year alone in both the solar installation and manufacturing sectors. <br /> 'While tariffs in this case will not create adequate cell or module manufacturing to meet U.S. demand, or keep foreign-owned Suniva and SolarWorld afloat, they will create a crisis in a part of our economy that has been thriving, which will ultimately cost tens of thousands of hard-working, blue-collar Americans their jobs,' Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA's chief executive, said in a scathing press release. <br /> In a joint statement, Suniva and SolarWold 'applauded' Trump, but urged him to increase the first-year tariff to 50 percent. <br /> 'Our companies and workers are grateful to hear the President understands the seriousness of the problem facing our solar manufacturers in Michigan, Georgia, Oregon and across the country,' said the statement, signed by SolarWorld Americas Inc. CEO Juergen Stein and Suniva executive vice president Matt Card. 'Now the President can save and rebuild this great American industry and create thousands of jobs by immediately imposing 50 percent tariffs ? the strongest tariffs possible.' <br /> Their complaint marked the first major trade case before the Trump administration, and offered a fascinating test of the president's 'American First' nationalist agenda, which has pushed fossil fuel production as its primary energy policy. The president, who has railed against renewable energy and dismissed climate change as a hoax, had significant discretion over Monday's decision, which loomed over the industry for months. <br /> The precise impact of the tariffs remains difficult to assess. Up to three-quarters of the solar projects scheduled for construction this year could be exempted, in part because companies already stockpiled imported equipment, Ethan Zindler, a Washington, D.C.-based analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, told [outlet]. <br /> 'But the 2019 build could be a very different story,' he said. <br /> The tariffs appear targeted to Chinese solar equipment, but the wording of the announcement was unclear, making it difficult to gauge how it will affect imports from Southeast Asia and Mexico. <br /> 'It's not great news for the industry,' Zindler concluded. 'But it certainly could have been worse.' <br /> The White House's announcement came as a relief to cynics who expected the president to impose the sort of draconian tariffs Suniva and SolarWorld proposed. <br /> That would have cost the industry 88,000 jobs nationwide, about 34 percent of the 260,000 Americans employed in solar in 2017, according to calculations released last June by SEIA. At risk would be 6,300 jobs in Texas, 4,700 in North Carolina 'and a whopping 7,000 in South Carolina,' the group said. <br /> Utility-scale projects, which, because of their size, are more sensitive to hardware price fluctuations, would face the biggest slowdown. That leaves the Southeast, where utilities have commissioned a massive surge of solar projects since 2015, particularly vulnerable to higher tariffs. <br /> 'Those plants haven't been built yet, they're just planned,' MJ Shiao, a solar analyst at GTM Research, told [outlet] ahead of Monday's announcement. 'The price of these plants won't be able to pencil out, and they will be canceled.' <br /> Wind energy developers could see a major benefit as states seeking to increase renewable energy capacity bolster incentives to build new turbines in place of solar farms. Natural gas, already the primary fuel of electricity in the U.S., would likely see a boost, too. Coal, the country's second-biggest source of electricity, would be unlikely to see a major impact because its main competitor for market share remains natural gas. Despite its recent gains, solar makes up just a fraction of renewable energy's 15 percent share of U.S. electricity generation. <br /> 'More good-paying jobs will be jeopardized by today's decision than could possibly be saved by bailing out the bankrupt companies that petitioned for protection,' said Clark Packard, trade policy counsel at the R Street Institute, a conservative think tank that advocates for climate change action. 'Today's decision also will jeopardize the environment by making clean energy sources less affordable.' <br /> Solar installation companies warned that tariffs could cost manufacturing jobs, too, as an industry tide pulled by cheap imports recedes and lowers all ships. Still, despite its struggles with cheap imports, the manufacturing sector saw a few bright spots before Trump decided to impose tariffs. <br /> In June, Chinese-owned Seraphim Solar announced plans to double the workforce at its Jackson, Mississippi, module-making plant. In August, Tesla's SolarCity division began producing solar cells at its new factory in Buffalo, New York. And trade disputes between countries have made manufacturing giants in Asia look abroad for new options. <br /> 'There are spats between the European Union and China and India and China,' Zindler said ahead of the announcement. 'A lot of Asian manufacturers are already looking to diversify where they are manufacturing.' <br /> 'But it takes a few years,' he added. 'So it's not like immediately you'd have a flood of factories in the U.S. owned by the Chinese. That won't happen overnight.' <br /> While Monday's announcement marks the White House's most significant blow to renewables yet, the Trump administration has consistently fought clean energy policies. <br /> Last year, Trump proposed a 2018 budget that slashed funding for the Energy Department's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy by 71.9 percent. The administration pushed a proposal designed by coal baron and Trump ally Bob Murray to bail out coal and nuclear power plants with a plan that would add $10.8 billion in ratepayer costs. The Environmental Protection Agency moved to repeal the Clean Power Plan, the nation's only major federal program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and incentivize utility-scale clean energy investments. <br /> The White House also illegally withheld $91 million in funding to ARPA-E, an experimental energy research program responsible for 'holy grail' breakthroughs in battery storage technology. <br /> 'If Trump really wants to put America first, he should reduce our reliance on polluting energy sources that fuel climate change,' said Howard Crystal, a senior attorney with the environmental nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity. 'Instead, this profoundly political move will make solar power more expensive for everyday Americans while propping up two failing, foreign-owned companies.' <br /> Do you have information you want to share with [outlet]?

But don't blame entitlements.", "Martin Neil Baily, Jason Furman, Alan B. Krueger, Laura D'Andrea Tyson and Janet L. Yellen are all former chairs of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. <br /> The U.S. unemployment rate is down to 4.1 percent, and economic growth could well increase in 2018. Consumer and business confidence is high. What could go wrong? <br /> A group of distinguished economists from the Hoover Institution, a public-policy think tank at Stanford University, identifies a serious problem. The federal budget deficit is on track to exceed $1 trillion next year and get worse over time. Eventually, ever-rising debt and deficits will cause interest rates to rise, and the portion of tax revenue needed to service the growing debt will take an increasing toll on the ability of government to provide for its citizens and to respond to recessions and emergencies. <br /> None of that is in dispute. But the Hoover economists then go wrong by arguing that entitlements are the sole cause of the problem, while the budget-busting tax bill that was passed last year is described as a 'good first step.' <br /> Entitlement programs support older Americans and those with low incomes or disabilities. Program costs are growing largely because of the aging of the population. This demographic problem is faced by almost all advanced economies and cannot be solved by a vague call to cut 'entitlements' - terminology that dehumanizes the value of these programs to millions of Americans. <br /> The deficit, of course, reflects the gap between spending and revenue. It is dishonest to single out entitlements for blame. The federal budget was in surplus from 1998 through 2001, but large tax cuts and unfunded wars have been huge contributors to our current deficit problem. The primary reason the deficit in coming years will now be higher than had been expected is the reduction in tax revenue from last year's tax cuts, not an increase in spending. This year, revenue is expected to fall below 17 percent of gross domestic product - the lowest it has been in the past 50 years with the exception of the aftermath of the past two recessions. <br /> All of us have supported corporate tax reform. The statutory tax rate was too high, much higher than in other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development economies. However, because of deductions and breaks in the tax code, the effective marginal tax rate was similar to the average among competitor economies. The right way to do reform was to follow the model of the bipartisan tax reform of 1986, when rates were lowered while deductions were eliminated. <br /> Instead, the tax cuts passed last year actually added an amount to America's long-run fiscal challenge that is roughly the same size as the preexisting shortfalls in Social Security and Medicare. The tax cuts are reducing revenue by an average of 1.1 percent of GDP over the next four years. The Hoover authors minimized the cost of the tax cuts by noting that if major provisions are allowed to expire on schedule - certainly an open question, given political realities - they would amount to 'only' 0.4 percent of GDP. Even this magnitude exceeds the Medicare Trustees' projections of a 0.3 percent of GDP shortfall in Medicare hospital insurance over the next 75 years. <br /> Just as entitlements are not the primary cause of the recent jump in the deficit, they also should not be the sole solution. It is important to use the right wording: The main entitlement programs are Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits and Medicaid. These widely popular programs are indeed large and projected to grow as a share of the economy, not because of increased generosity of benefits but because of the aging of the population and the increase in economywide health costs. <br /> There is some room for additional spending reductions in these programs, but not to an extent large enough to solve the long-run debt problem. The Social Security program needs only modest reforms to restore its 75-year solvency, and these should include adjustments in both spending and revenue. Additional revenue is critical because Social Security has become even more vital as fewer and fewer people have defined-benefit pensions. Medicare has been a leader in bending the health-care cost curve. Reforms to payments and reformed benefit structures in Medicare could do more to hold down its future costs. <br /> As we focus on the long-run fiscal situation, our goal should be to put the debt on a declining path as a share of the economy. That will require running smaller deficits in strong economic periods - such as the present - to offset the larger deficits that are needed in recessions to restore demand and avoid deeper crises. Last year's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act turned that economic logic on its head. The economy was already at or close to full employment and did not need a boost. This year's bipartisan spending agreement contributed further to the ill-timed stimulus. The Federal Reserve will have to act to make sure the economy does not overheat. <br /> Several years ago, there was broad agreement that responding to the looming fiscal challenge required a balanced approach that combined increased revenue with reduced spending. Two bipartisan commissions, Simpson-Bowles and Domenici-Rivlin, proposed such approaches that called for tax reform to raise revenue as a percent of GDP and judicious spending cuts. Without necessarily agreeing with these specific plans, we believe a balanced approach is the correct one. Start with spending goals based on the priorities of the American people and then set tax policy to realize adequate revenue. The Hoover economists' advocacy of paying for large tax cuts with entitlement reductions would take the United States in the wrong direction. <br /> Read more on this issue: <br /> Robert J.

According to her website, she had channels in English, Turkish, and Farsi, as well as one dedicated to 'hand art,' which was devoted to the making of beaded necklaces. <br /> In other videos, she appeared to promote veganism and animal rights, demonstrate workout routines, inveigh against capitalism, authority, and popular culture, and make bizarre parody music videos. According to [outlet], on her Instagram account, which has since been suspended, she described herself as an 'Athlete Artist Comedian Poet Model Singer Host Actor Director Producer.' <br /> Her father, Ismail Aghdam, told media outlets on Tuesday that his daughter made a living from the videos and that she had become increasingly angry about YouTube's Feb. 20 move to demonetize smaller channels.

Now that agreement is in doubt. <br /> Pressures on European companies 'are actually intended consequences,' according to a senior State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under department ground rules. With virtually no existing U.S. economic relationship with Iran, the official said, 'secondary sanctions,' primarily affecting Europe and Asia, are among the best ways to squeeze Iran's economy. <br /> The United States used secondary sanctions to isolate Iran before the nuclear agreement, the official said. 'That's what we want to do again. It's not about sanctioning foreign companies; it's about using the leverage and engaging the way we did before.' <br /> 'The sanctions worked last time,' Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told [outlet], and brought Iran to the bargaining table. The goal now is to partner with allies to push Iran to negotiate a new agreement that will cover nuclear activities as well as ballistic missiles and destabilizing Iranian activity in Syria, Yemen and beyond. <br /> The administration took Macron's Tuesday tweet saying he was prepared to 'work together on a broader framework,' covering all of Iran's bad behavior, as evidence 'that France is eager to be part of an effort' to pressure Iran, the State Department official said. <br /> However, after the new U.S. ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, tweeted that 'German companies doing business in Iran should wind down operations immediately,' Bruno Le Maire, France's finance minister, fired back that the United States should not consider itself the world's 'economic policeman.' <br /> Hours into his new job, Trump's ambassador to Germany offends his hosts <br /> In a statement, the E.U. said that 'sanctions lifting has a positive impact on trade and economic relations with Iran. The E.U. stresses its commitment to ensuring that this can continue to be delivered.' <br /> Eric Schweitzer, head of the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said it is 'incomprehensible that the activities of German companies should still suffer' while the E.U. remains committed to the accord. <br /> About 120 German companies operate in Iran with their own staff, and 10,000 German companies do business with Iran, according to the German-Iranian Chamber of Industry and Commerce. <br /> As explained by the State and Treasury departments, U.S. measures will be implemented in several phases. All new contracts with Iran are immediately banned. <br /> All existing contracts must be terminated within 90 days, with the exception of energy-related relationships and contracts, which are being given a 180-day 'wind-down' period. 'We wanted to be careful on the energy markets, that we had an orderly transition away from Iranian oil,' Mnuchin said. <br /> Oil prices rose more than 3 percent Wednesday, hitting the highest levels in more than three years. <br /> The administration will also redesignate all Iranian individuals and entities who were specifically sanctioned by the U.S. government before the nuclear agreement went into effect - a total of at least 600. <br /> In Europe, the U.S. withdrawal from the accord has been seen as a significant blow to transatlantic relations - more devastating than Trump's decisions to take the United States out of the Paris climate accords, formally recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and threaten unilateral sanctions on aluminum and steel. No other issue saw European leaders go to such lengths to change Trump's mind over such a lengthy period of time, and none ended in greater humiliation. <br /> There are some measures that European leaders can take to try to protect European enterprise in Iran. <br /> 'Europeans need to at least debate threatening to impose costs on U.S. action,' said Ellie Geranmayeh, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. She suggested that E.U. leaders could respond to secondary sanctions by targeting American companies in Europe. <br /> The question, Geranmayeh said, is 'the extent to which the Europeans are going to allow their own companies to be hamstrung by U.S. foreign policy.' <br /> But European companies will likely respond to an ultimatum from Washington, political analysts said. Given the size of the U.S. market and the power of U.S. banks, European companies would have comparatively little leverage. <br /> 'The E.U. can take steps to mitigate the impact of the sanctions,' said Luigi Scazzieri of the London-based Center for European Reform. 'But overall, companies will be scared. They will also prioritize their business with the U.S.' <br /> DeYoung reported from Washington.

Dimaya held that a part of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) used to deport criminal aliens was unconstitutionally 'vague.' Fortunately, this is a problem Congress could easily remedy with a very simple legislative fix. Only those opposed to safeguarding the public from convicted felons could possibly oppose it. <br /> At issue was a provision of the INA that defines what a 'crime of violence' is for purposes of removal proceedings. Under federal law, if an alien is convicted of an 'aggravated felony,' he is subject to deportation even if he is in the country legally. The INA has a long list of specific offenses that fit the 'aggravated felony' definition, one of which is a 'crime of violence' punishable by at least a year in prison. <br /> The man at the center of this case, James Dimaya, is a lawful permanent resident alien from the Philippines. The U.S. moved to deport him after his second felony conviction for first-degree burglary under California law. An immigration court ordered Dimaya's deportation because it found that first-degree burglary met the 'crime of violence' definition. <br /> Why? Because a 'crime of violence' is further defined in federal law as any felony that poses 'a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.' <br /> The immigration court believed that such a risk is present in a first-degree burglary when a criminal is breaking into an occupied residence. However, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the law was unconstitutionally vague. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote an insightful concurring opinion in which he talked about the dangers of vague laws like this one that can lead to the arbitrary exercise of governmental power: <br /> Just take the crime at issue in this case, California burglary, which applies to everyone from armed home intruders to door-to-door salesmen peddling shady products. How, on the vast spectrum, is anyone supposed to locate the ordinary case and say whether it includes a substantial risk of physical force? The truth is, no one knows. <br /> Even if you disagree with the majority's holding in the case, the fact remains that some violent felons who are aliens won't be subject to removal proceedings and deportation because the Court found that part of the law too vague and thus constitutionally deficient. <br /> The problem, as usual, is an overly complicated and overly long federal law. <br /> The provision in the INA listing all the criminal offenses for which you can be deported has categories running through almost the entire alphabet, from '(A) murder, rape, or sexual abuse of a minor' through '(U) an attempt or conspiracy to commit an offense described in this paragraph . . .' A 'crime of violence' is described in part (F) of this lengthy litany. <br /> But aliens who are legally in this country are guests who should be allowed to remain here only as long as they abide by our laws. That's not a big ask. <br /> When someone commits a felony, whether it is a crime of violence or not, it's a very serious offense. When someone repeatedly commits misdemeanor crimes, that is also evidence that they have no respect for our laws and shouldn't be allowed to continue to be a guest in our country. <br /> We don't need a long, complex laundry list of all of the different crimes that will void your guest pass to be here. Congress could easily pass a very simple but highly effective amendment that could not be misconstrued by judges. It should say you are immediately deportable from this country if you are: <br /> * Convicted of a felony offense, regardless of its nature, under federal law or the laws of any state or territory of the United States; or <br /> * Convicted of two or more misdemeanor offenses under federal law or the laws of any state or territory of the United States. <br /> That's an easy, straightforward solution to the Dimaya decision. <br /> If Congress wants to protect the American public from criminal aliens such as James Dimaya, who clearly should be deported, it could pass such a provision tomorrow, and President Trump could sign it the next day. <br /> And the only members of Congress who would oppose it are those who think that criminal aliens, including repeat offenders, should remain in the country - an untenable and indefensible position."], "ID12" : ["https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/02/ivanka-trumps-comments-monica-lewinsky-essay-and-what-happens-when-you-arm-teachers-in-slates-daily-newsletter.html", "Ivanka and Monica, Armed Teachers, and 'Assimilation' Politics", "Most powerful cipher: Ivanka's very presence in the White House, wielding the power that she's been given out of no virtue of her own, is a travesty, Jamelle Bouie writes.

But his senior aides again persuaded him not to dissolve it, as did European allies, who said Iran was still abiding by the terms of the deal and that breaching it would play into the hands of hard liners in the country. <br /> The White House is expected to play up the sanctions against Iranian officials as a symbol of Mr. Trump's displeasure with the Islamic Republic's government - and solidarity with those who are rallying against it. <br /> Several officials said they expected Mr. Trump to warn that he would not waive the sanctions again unless Congress agreed on legislation to tighten the nuclear deal. He is also expected to demand that European leaders fall in line - something that seems even less likely after the political unrest in Iran. <br /> Still, Mr. Trump's expected action is most important for what he will not do: reinstate sanctions on Iran's central bank and oil exports, which were lifted as an inducement to Tehran for constraining its nuclear program. That would have almost certainly unraveled the agreement - and it may yet, since Mr. Trump has warned he will dismantle the deal if he cannot improve it. <br /> Mr. Trump's decision came after a Thursday meeting with his national security team on a turbulent day, during which he made a vulgar reference to immigrants in a meeting with senators and told The Wall Street Journal, 'I probably have a very good relationship with Kim Jong-un.' <br /> Starting on Friday, Mr. Trump faces a series of deadlines related to the nuclear deal and sanctions that were waived as a result of it. The first of those deadlines - for extending or terminating the waiver for the central bank and oil sanctions - is by the far the most significant. <br /> In October, Mr. Trump refused to certify the agreement - a decision he is expected to reaffirm next week. At the time, the president warned that he would take further action to nullify the deal if Congress and the allies did not act. <br /> 'In the event we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies,' he said over the fall, 'then the agreement will be terminated.' <br /> Republicans in the Senate have drafted legislation that would amend the deal by eliminating its 'sunset provisions,' under which Iran is allowed to resume activities like enriching uranium. But they have so far been unable to bridge gaps with the Democratic caucus. <br /> There is also no evidence that the Europeans have the appetite to reopen the deal. On Thursday, hours before Mr. Trump made his decision, European foreign ministers met in Brussels with Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, ostensibly to press Tehran about its destabilizing activities in the region, which are putting the nuclear deal at risk. <br /> But to some in Washington, the meeting amounted to a show of unity between Europe and Iran - and of defiance toward the United States. There were images of a smiling Mr. Zarif, seated among smiling European officials, followed by a parade of statements in favor of the deal. <br /> 'I don't think anybody has so far produced a better alternative,' said the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. 'The Iran nuclear deal makes the world safer. European partners were unanimous today in our determination to preserve the deal and tackle Iran's disruptive behavior.' <br /> The European Union's foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, said, 'The deal is working - it is delivering on its main goal which means keeping the Iranian nuclear program in check and under close surveillance.' <br /> In a phone call, President Emmanuel Macron of France also urged Mr. Trump not to scrap the deal. Mr. Macron 'reaffirmed France's determination to see the agreement strictly enforced and the importance for all of its signatories to abide by it,' his office said in a statement. <br /> Privately, some White House officials complained about the phone call with Mr. Macron, which they said could have provoked Mr. Trump. Others said the diplomatic meeting in Brussels was similarly ill conceived, and they expressed frustration that the legislative efforts in Congress were not progressing quickly enough. <br /> 'Legislative gimmicks that don't permanently fix the Iran nuclear deal under U.S. law, regardless of which party controls the White House, and continued European photo-ops with Javad Zarif are like waving a red flag in front of an angry bull,' said Mark Dubowitz, the chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. <br /> 'It could lead Trump to kill the deal, now or soon,' he said."], "ID14" : ["https://www.foxnews.com/politics/homeland-security-adviser-tom-bossert-resigns-white-house-says", "Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert resigns, White House says", "White House Homeland Security Advisor Thomas Bossert resigned Tuesday, just one day after President Trump's new national security adviser, Ambassador John Bolton, began his tenure in the National Security Council. <br /> White House officials confirmed Bossert's resignation to [outlet] Tuesday morning. <br /> 'The President is grateful for Tom's commitment to the safety and security of our great country,' White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.

No, the president did not dictate a misleading statement released in his son's name. <br /> 'He certainly didn't dictate,' said the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. <br /> 'The president was not involved in the drafting of that statement,' his lawyer Jay Sekulow told NBC News. <br /> 'That was written by Donald Trump Jr., and I'm sure in consultation with his lawyer,' Mr. Sekulow told [outlet]. <br /> 'The president didn't sign off on anything,' he told ABC. <br /> But in a confidential, hand-delivered memo to the special counsel, Mr. Trump's lawyers acknowledged that, yes, Mr. Trump had dictated the statement, which attempted to deflect questions about a meeting with a Kremlin-tied lawyer at Trump Tower. Prosecutors are asking whether the statement was part of an effort by the president to obstruct a federal investigation. <br /> Even for a president whose false statements have been constantly cited by fact-checkers, this was a stark private acknowledgment of what was a repeated public falsehood. And it sums up the dilemma that Mr. Trump faces as he weighs whether to sit for an interview with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. <br /> The misleading statement is but one aspect of Mr. Mueller's investigation. But it highlights a communication strategy that the White House has used repeatedly: deny facts, attack news outlets and dismiss journalism as 'fake news.' <br /> Late last year, for example, reporters revealed a White House plan to fire the secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, and replace him with the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo. Not so, Mr. Trump angrily replied, dismissing the stories as fake news. Ultimately, Mr. Trump fired Mr. Tillerson, replaced him with Mr. Pompeo and said he had been talking about doing so 'for a long time.' <br /> The situation is more complicated and perilous now that Mr. Mueller is seeking to interview the president. Fact-checkers spring into action when Mr. Trump mischaracterizes immigration law or passes off debunked fables as historical facts. But there are few repercussions. In the witness chair with Mr. Mueller, the president would face serious consequences for lying. <br /> Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, has pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. So have two former campaign advisers, George Papadopoulos and Rick Gates. A former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, has pleaded not guilty to charges of making false statements to the government. <br /> Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, acknowledged as much in an ABC News interview this weekend, even as he blamed the string of false statements on faulty memory and incorrect assumptions. 'This is the reason you don't let the president testify,' Mr. Giuliani said. 'Our recollection keeps changing, or we're not even asked a question and somebody makes an assumption.' <br /> But Mr. Trump's team was asked the question, again and again, by multiple reporters. The answer was consistent. Then on Monday, Ms. Sanders refused to answer the question or address her previous denial. 'I'm not going to get into a back-and-forth,' she said, when pressed to explain her remarks. Mr. Sekulow said on Monday that the legal memo 'reflects our understanding of the events that occurred.' <br /> The [outlet] reported last July that, during the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Trump's eldest son, hosted a meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer who had promised to bring political dirt on Hillary Clinton. The lawyer was offering the meeting, emails showed, as part of the Russian government's support for the Trump campaign. <br /> But when approached by journalists, the younger Mr. Trump issued a statement that omitted all of that. Instead, the statement said that the meeting had primarily been about Russian adoption policy. When The Times reported that the president himself had 'signed off on' the statement, Mr. Trump's advisers pushed back hard. <br /> 'They're incorrect,' Mr. Sekulow said on [outlet]. <br /> 'The [outlet] is wrong?' he was asked. <br /> 'Yeah, I know, is that shocking that sometimes they make a mistake?' Mr. Sekulow said. <br /> Then The Washington Post reported that Mr. Trump had not only approved it, but had personally dictated it. Mr. Sekulow responded, 'Apart from being of no consequence, the characterizations are misinformed, inaccurate and not pertinent.' <br /> The Times has since obtained a confidential memo to Mr. Mueller acknowledging that 'the president dictated a short but accurate response to The [outlet] article on behalf of his son, Donald Trump, Jr.' The memo adds that 'this subject is a private matter with The [outlet].' <br /> Mr. Trump has for years held the view that fudging the facts with journalists is far from a federal offense, and has acknowledged as much in civil lawsuits. He has acknowledged practicing what he calls 'truthful hyperbole,' and has waved away outright falsehoods, dismissing them as smart public relations. Asked in court why he overstated his property sales on national television, Mr. Trump replied, 'We do want to put the best spin on the property.' <br /> After his firing, Mr. Tillerson delivered a barely veiled criticism of his former boss's trustworthiness, declaring that American democracy was threatened by a crisis of integrity. 'When we as people, a free people, go wobbly on the truth even on what may seem the most trivial matters, we go wobbly on America,' he said in a commencement address last month. <br /> Mr. Mueller has told Mr. Trump's lawyers that only by interviewing the president can prosecutors determine whether he had intended to obstruct justice. Mr. Trump has said he is eager to sit for an interview. He told reporters in January that he expected to do so within 'two to three weeks.' <br /> That did not happen, and his lawyers are not sure it ever will."], "ID17" : ["https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/04/comey-confirms-in-clinton-emails-caper-the-fix-was-in/", "Comey Confirms: In Clinton Emails Caper, the Fix Was In", "While promoting his memoir, A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership, former FBI director James Comey sat for what turned out to be a tough but fair and refreshingly civil interview by Bret Baier, host of [outlet]'s Special Report. (See Part 1 and Part 2.) Owing to President Trump's comparatively unhinged interview earlier in the day on Fox & Friends, the Trump-Comey feud over alleged leaking of classified information is drawing most of the media attention. But something more important is less apparent: Comey has implicitly confirmed what we've been saying here for well over a year: In the Clinton emails caper, the fix was in. <br /> Before we turn first to leaking, some disclosure. I am fond of Jim Comey and have been for 30 years. I vigorously disagree with both his handling of the Clinton emails investigation and the manner in which the FBI has conducted what is supposed to be a classified, counterintelligence probe of Russia's interference in the 2016 election - not a public, government-orchestrated campaign of insinuation that Trump was complicit in Russian perfidy. <br /> No doubt because of my personal regard for him and respect for his high-end ability, I am inclined to cut the former director slack. He was thrust into a no-win situation: It is not his fault that Democrats nominated a criminal suspect, or that Republicans nominated an irregular politician heedless of the norms of discretion and distance that a president should maintain when dealing with his law-enforcement subordinates. Comey aside, I had no better friends in nearly 20 years as a federal prosecutor in New York than Dan Richman, the Columbia Law School prof through whom Comey transmitted information to the [outlet], and Pat Fitzgerald and Dave Kelley, Comey's lawyers. These aren't just former colleagues of mine; they are old friends. I haven't tried to speak to any of them about this matter, but my esteem for them weighs on me - as does my duty to be an honest analyst. How well I resolve that tension is not for me to say; I can just tell you it is real. <br /> Comey Did Not Leak Classified Information<br />Notwithstanding the president's insistence that Comey leaked classified information, the known evidence strongly suggests that this is not the case. To be clear, there are significant problems with the former director's account, but the claim that he committed a crime is specious. <br /> The leak claim centers on a memo-to-self Comey wrote about a White House meeting on February 14, 2017, in which he alleges that the president asked him to drop the investigation of Michael Flynn, the former national-security adviser whom Trump had fired the preceding day. Several months ago, when we first learned that Comey had written memos of his conversations with the president, I observed that they were unlikely to be classified because Comey, who is smart and careful, would avoid including such information. Well, the memos were made public about a week ago, and we now know that the one in question is not classified. (See here, pp. 10-11.) Obviously, unless information is classified, the criminal laws against unauthorized disclosure of such information are inapposite. <br /> As for the rest of the story, the best thing Comey has going for him is Trump. In his over-the-top way, the president publicly accused the former director of a felony, so the controversy is focused on whether Comey is guilty of a crime-which he is not. <br /> But an incident can be disturbing without being incriminating. <br /> Comey's claim that his memos constitute personal 'aide-memoire' rather than government reports is untenable. Imagine a criminal case, in which federal law requires the government to disclose to the defense all prior witness statements in its possession. An FBI agent joins other investigators in conducting surveillance. Although he was not responsible for writing the official FBI report, the agent realizes he may someday be called to testify. So, when he gets home, he jots down notes of what he observed in a diary. He rationalizes that his notes are his personal memory and his diary is his personal property; they do not belong to the government. Therefore, he does not turn in a copy of the notes for the government's file. <br /> If our hypothetical agent were ever called to testify, any judge in America would rule that the notes are constructively government property, and that the government must produce them to the defense. They would be deemed a government record generated by a government agent in the course of and in relation to official government business. <br /> If Comey had not been the FBI director, he would not have had these discussions with the president of the United States about investigations. His memos, clearly, were made in the course of and in relation to his official duties. They were written on FBI-issued equipment. The standard FBI employment agreement unambiguously states: <br /> All information acquired by me in connection with my official duties with the FBI and all official material to which I have access remain the property of the United States of America. <br /> These memos belonged to the government. The information in them belongs to the government. Indeed, some of the memos evince Comey's understanding of this: Two are in the form of emails Comey sent to his top FBI staffers - one with the subject line 'My notes from private session with PE [President-elect] on 1/16/17'; another, dated March 1, 2017, with the subject line 'Call from POTUS.' Of course, we know that the FBI was scrutinizing the campaign Trump ran, and that Comey says Trump had pressured him to drop the Flynn investigation. So Trump - regardless of what Comey was telling him in their face-to-face conversations - was a subject of FBI investigations. Palpably, that's why the director shared his notes with the team running the investigations - even asking, in the first memo, whether in designating it 'SECRET' he had chosen 'the proper classification.' (The first memo ('1/16/17'), which was not leaked to the media, is classified and contains redactions.) <br /> The fact that the memos were government property is important because the former director has posited a Clintonesque objection to accusations that he 'leaked' information. He had already been fired when he gave the February 14 memo to Richman with instructions to pass it on to the Times. Thus, his theory goes, he was merely a private citizen passing along his personal aide-memoire. <br /> But in fact, the February 14 memo (the physical memo and its informational content) belonged to the government. Comey orchestrated the transmission of its contents to the media without authorization. That's a leak, period. Comey has tried to circumvent this inconvenience by a crimped definition of 'leak' - it is only, he told [outlet]'s Anderson Cooper, the 'unauthorized disclosure of classified information.' No, that is a classified leak. Other unauthorized disclosures to the media of non-public government information may not be quite as serious, but they are still leaks. <br /> As a matter of fact, most non-public investigative information the FBI generates is not classified, yet its unauthorized disclosure is forbidden - and rightly so: A great deal of non-classified information is highly sensitive, and its disclosure could endanger lives and destroy investigations. No surprise, then, that the FBI employment agreement outlines several categories of information (I count 13 of them besides classified information) that officials are prohibited from disclosing without authorization. As of the moment he was fired, the former director was no longer empowered to authorize the dissemination of non-public government information outside the government. Absent permission from a qualified official, he simply was not authorized to cause the release to the media of an FBI-generated memo about a meeting between the president and the FBI director (even though he wrote the memo and was the director in question). To his credit, Comey conceded to Baier that, while the claim that he leaked classified information is frivolous, the question of whether he violated his employment agreement is not. <br /> Having defensible reasons makes Comey's actions understandable, but not appropriate. He leaked, and he should not have leaked. It was not a crime, but it should not have happened. <br /> Moreover, all high executive-branch officials know that conversations with the president about official business are potentially covered by executive privilege. That is why executive officials typically refuse in congressional testimony to answer questions about conversations with the president - the privilege belongs to the president. An executive official who discloses without authorization deprives the president the opportunity to assert the privilege lawfully. <br /> Comey was not without his reasons. Trump had ominously and falsely suggested that there were secret recordings of his conversations with the former director. Although the president's intimation was that Comey might lie about these conversations, Comey believed any tapes would corroborate his version of events. So, he reasonably figured that, by disclosing his account of the Flynn meeting, he might force disclosure of any recordings Trump had - perhaps through a special-counsel investigation of whether the Flynn conversation amounted to obstruction. As it happens, after a special counsel was appointed, the president admitted there were no recordings. <br /> Having defensible reasons makes Comey's actions understandable, but not appropriate. He leaked, and he should not have leaked. It was not a crime, but it should not have happened. <br /> Yes, the Fix Was In<br />These columns have repeatedly pointed out that the decision whether to indict Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified information was not the FBI's call. It was up to the Obama Justice Department, which was in the tank for Mrs. Clinton and was taking direction from President Obama. In April 2016, Obama publicly stated that he did not want his party's inevitable nominee charged with a crime. <br /> In making that assertion, Obama distorted the Espionage Act, falsely implying that it required proof of intent to harm the United States before someone could be convicted of mishandling classified information. To the contrary, the law holds that a person is guilty (1) if she willfully causes the unauthorized transmission of classified information - meaning if she understands the wrongfulness of the action and intentionally performs it anyway - or (2) if through 'gross negligence' she permits the information to be removed from its proper place or to be otherwise mishandled (see Section 793(d), (e), and (f) of Title 18, U.S. Code). The Justice Department adopted Obama's erroneous intent standard, as, ultimately, did Comey. <br /> The former director's statements in the Brett Baier interview firmly establish that the decision not to indict Mrs. Clinton was based on Obama Justice Department standards, not on the terms of the statute. <br /> For example, when asked why he was confident, long before Clinton was even interviewed, that she would not be charged, Comey said the investigators working the case told him, 'Look boss, on the current course and speed, it looks like it's not gonna get to a place where the prosecutors would bring it.' It was not that the evidence was insufficient under the law; it was that the Justice Department would not indict. <br /> Baier then played a now-familiar recording of Comey, under questioning by Representative Trey Gowdy (R., S.C.), conceding that Clinton had made various false claims about her emails (no emails 'marked 'classified,'' no classified emails sent or stored, all work-related emails returned to the State Department). Baier then asked why, despite this pattern, Comey had made his decision against charges even before Clinton was questioned. While denying that he had made a final decision at that point, he said he had a 'general sense' that the evidence was 'unlikely to get us to a place where they would prosecute at the Justice Department.' <br /> Comey is trying to have it both ways: He wants you to accept that he made the decision not to prosecute on his own, out of fear that the Justice Department was tainted by bias in Clinton's favor. Yet, when dismissing critics' claims that the proof was more than adequate under the applicable law, he shrugs his shoulders and says, in effect, 'What could I do? I was constrained by the Justice Department's interpretation of the law.' That is, his hand was forced by the same pro-Clinton bias that he was supposedly thwarting. <br /> This became excruciatingly apparent when Baier pointed out the care Comey took to describe Clinton's conduct as 'extremely careless' rather than 'grossly negligent' - the state of mind criminalized by the Espionage Act. Though these terms are substantively indistinguishable, this semantic ploy enabled Comey to obscure the inconvenience that Clinton was guilty under the statute as written. Comey's retort was telling: <br /> I was struggling with the fact that we thought it was not mere sloppiness but didn't rise to the level of criminal misconduct that the Justice Department would prosecute. So, how do you describe that? I probably should have said 'really sloppy.' I wanted to be honest and say, 'It's above 'sloppy.' It doesn't add up to what the 1917 statute meant when it said, ''Grossly negligent' is a felony.' <br /> No, to be honest, the FBI just has to describe what she did. If what she did was extremely careless, then that does add up to 'grossly negligent' under the 1917 statute - but it is for the Justice Department to connect those legal dots. If Obama's Justice officials fail to do so, that's politics, not law enforcement, so why let the non-partisan FBI get dragged into it? It is not the FBI's job to make pronouncements on the law. It is not the FBI's burden to pull out the thesaurus and don Mrs. Clinton's misconduct in just the right lexical finery until it finally fits the Obama Justice Department's misinterpretation of a clear criminal statute. <br /> It was not the FBI's task to manage Mrs. Clinton's risks or defend the Obama Justice Department's politicized enforcement standards. <br /> Again, Comey would have us see him, simultaneously, as the stalwart check on potential Justice Department corruption and the helpless slave of Justice Department direction. But he can't be both. The simple fact is: Nothing obliged him to exercise prosecutorial discretion in the emails investigation. The FBI's job was to investigate, not to decide whether the evidence was sufficient to support an indictment. If he was worried that Attorney General Loretta Lynch was conflicted, the upright move was to advise her to step aside - and to do it not at the end but at an earlier point, when it might have helped the FBI get out from under the irregular constraints her Justice Department was imposing on investigators. And a prosecutor's conflict is not a basis for the FBI to appropriate her authority - Lynch had a deputy and other subordinates who could have acted as attorney general if her recusal was warranted. <br /> More to the point, there was no need to say anything. There is no requirement that the FBI or the Justice Department ever announce that an investigation has been closed. The former director keeps asking, 'What was I to do' under these difficult circumstances? The answer is: nothing. The government speaks in court, when a person is formally accused of a crime and has the full pallet of due-process rights to defend herself. Unless and until that happens, no one is entitled to know whether an investigation exists or what its status may be. <br /> The public did not have the right to know what was happening in the Clinton investigation. In fact, we recently learned in connection with the inspector-general's report on Comey's deputy, Andrew McCabe, that Comey had quite properly tried to conceal the existence of an ongoing investigation of the Clinton Foundation. It was not Comey's fault that the Democrats nominated someone under criminal suspicion, but neither was it Comey's duty to remove the suspicion. Indeed, Comey repeatedly told Trump that the FBI could not publicly say Trump was not a suspect: If new evidence ever emerged that turned Trump into a suspect, Comey explained, he would be obliged to correct the misimpression. <br /> So why not the same rules for Clinton? After all, those are the rules. When the Democrats nominated Clinton, they were knowingly running the risk that the investigation might explode her candidacy. If the country had elected her, we would have been running the risk (however minimal) that a Clinton Justice Department might someday indict her. It was not the FBI's task to manage Mrs. Clinton's risks or defend the Obama Justice Department's politicized enforcement standards. <br /> Director Comey took it upon himself to do both. It was not possible simultaneously to do that and to protect the FBI from the fallout."], "ID18" : ["usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/04/27/teacher-pay-walkouts-arizona-west-virginia-oklahoma-nyc-michael-bloomberg-randi-weingarten-column/553407002", "We can expect more from teachers when we pay them like pros: Bloomberg and Weingarten", "Never before has there been so much labor unrest in America's public schools. Teachers, understandably angry about low pay and harmful cuts in education resources, have organized statewide walkouts in West Virginia, Kentucky and Oklahoma. Arizona and Mississippi may be next to act. This time of tension and frustration is also a moment of tremendous opportunity - to increase teachers' pay, acknowledge the importance of their work, strengthen accountability, ensure adequate education resources, and, most importantly, achieve the outcomes we need and want for all our kids. <br /> We know this from experience. In 2002, one of us was a newly elected mayor; the other, the leader of the teachers union. We had plenty of disagreements, but we shared a fundamental goal: to provide students and families in the city we love great public schools. We both knew that must include raising teacher salaries, securing additional resources for schools, and raising standards and expectations for both teachers and students. <br /> More: Teachers rising up in rebellion of 'everyday heroes': Randi Weingarten <br /> More: Trump's awful plan to arm teachers is straight from the NRA playbook <br /> Funding for New York City public schools was inadequate. Teachers had gone years without a raise and were badly underpaid, which made attracting and retaining great teachers difficult. Indeed, in 2002, thousands of teachers in New York City were not certified. <br /> We agreed that the status quo was not acceptable. Graduation rates had hovered around 50% for two decades, and the system was plagued by patronage, dilapidated buildings, insufficient supplies and dysfunctional management. <br /> We had very different ideas about how to improve the schools. That's the nature of labor-management relations. But our negotiations were guided by a shared principle: Teachers are valuable professionals deserving better pay and greater authority in exchange for greater accountability. <br /> The first contract we negotiated included a substantial raise, a longer school day and greater responsibilities for teachers. In subsequent contracts, we further increased salaries across the board, with senior teachers earning more than $100,000, and extended school time for tutoring struggling students and professional development. We also addressed long-standing complaints - making the often lengthy due process procedures for disciplining teachers more fair, transparent and streamlined; ending the frequent reassignment of new teachers from school to school; and giving principals more autonomy in hiring decisions. <br /> These and other changes helped decrease the number of uncertified teachers, reduce new-teacher attrition, improve student achievement, and create confidence in the promise and potential of New York City's public schools. By 2013, August graduation rates had risen 20 percentage points since 2002. Of the top-performing elementary and middle schools on the state's Common Core exams, 22 of 25 were city schools, compared to zero when we started. The city's schools, viewed as gems in earlier generations, started regaining their luster, and we both were proud of their progress. <br /> More: Starvation issues in universities? The real college problem is obesity. <br /> POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media <br /> Meanwhile, the city's education budget more than doubled, far outpacing spending by the state and federal governments, and teachers' base pay increased 43% between 2002 and 2008. And that's as it should be; teachers play an essential role in our society, and their wages and benefits must reflect that. <br /> Great teachers are critically important to raising student achievement. When Bloomberg Philanthropies looks for school systems around the country to support, one of the factors it examines is teacher salaries. Districts that refuse to pay their teachers adequately aren't well-positioned to raise student achievement levels. <br /> Teacher salaries vary widely by district and state, but in too many places, teachers are grossly underpaid compared with comparable professionals - a gap that is widening. Before the walkout in West Virginia, starting teachers there made $31,000, with median pay at only $45,000. Teachers in some other states - including Oklahoma, where teachers are now walking out - make even less. <br /> Professionals who have earned college and graduate degrees and do the essential work of educating our children should be able to live a middle-class life - not have to take second jobs or go on public assistance to care for their families. If we want smart, talented and ambitious college graduates to enter the teaching profession - and if we want our children to be able to compete in the global economy - we have to offer salaries that make the profession attractive. <br /> Over the years, we debated, sometimes fiercely, how best to improve public schools, including whether to create community schools, the role of public charter schools, data and standardized testing, and how to fix chronically struggling schools. Neither of us ever got as much as we wanted. But by recognizing that New York City's public schools would gain from the mayor and the head of the teachers union talking, listening and compromising, we made real and sustainable progress for our kids. <br /> The same principle applies nationwide. Public education is fundamentally a local matter, and states and districts reap what they sow. The federal government can push and prod, but it is up to districts and states - with labor and management working together, bargaining collectively and engaging with community - to drive long-term, sustainable change. <br /> As educators across the country demand better pay and better learning and teaching conditions, elected officials have an extraordinary opportunity to sit down with them to discuss changes that are good for kids, are fair to teachers and benefit communities. That's the only way we'll be able to give America's children the knowledge and skills they need to pursue their dreams. <br /> Michael Bloomberg is the former mayor of New York City. Randi Weingarten is the president of the American Federation of Teachers. <br /> "], "ID19" : ["nypost.com/2018/03/21/epa-chief-spent-120k-in-public-funds-on-italy-trip", "EPA chief spent $120K in public funds on Italy trip", "WASHINGTON - Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt spent more than $120,000 in public funds last summer for a trip to Italy that included a meeting of G-7 ministers and a private tour of the Vatican. <br /> The known cost of Pruitt's previously reported trip grew this week after the agency disclosed a heavily censored document showing expenses for Pruitt's security detail cost more than $30,500. <br /> That's on top of nearly $90,000 spent for food, hotels, commercial airfare and a military jet used by Pruitt and nine EPA staff. <br /> Last June, Pruitt flew to Bologna, Italy, for a meeting of environmental ministers from the world's top seven economies. Pruitt attended only the first few hours of the summit before leaving early to jet back to Washington for a cabinet meeting at the White House. <br /> The trip came a week after the Trump administration announced its plans to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. He also went to Rome for a briefing at the US Embassy, a meeting with business leaders and private tours of the Vatican and St. Peter's Basilica. <br /> The latest records were released following a lawsuit filed by the Environmental Integrity Project, an advocacy group. <br /> Pruitt is the first EPA administrator to require a full-time security detail that guards him day and night, the total cost of which has not been disclosed.
